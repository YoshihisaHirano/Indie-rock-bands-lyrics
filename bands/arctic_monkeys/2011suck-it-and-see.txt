She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
I've been feeling foolish
You should try it
She came and substituted
The peace and quiet for
Acrobatic blood flow
Concertina cheating heart beat
Rapid fire
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Here is your host
Sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms
She's been loop the looping
Around my mind
Her motorcycle boots give me
This kind of acrobatic blood
Concertina cheating heart beat
Rapid fire
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
In an unusual place
When you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
Thunderstorms
Lately I've been seeing things
Belly button piercings
In the sky at night
When we're side by side
And I don't mean to rain on anybody's cabriolet
One of those games you're gonna lose
But you wanna play it just in case
Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide
Does it help you stay up late?
Does it help you concentrate?
Does it tune you in when you chew your chin?
Am I ruining your fun?
And you talk the talk alright
But do you walk the walk or catch the train?
You wanted it, you got it
But you don't want it now
Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
More like black treacle than tar
Black treacle
Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
And so they found a place to hide
Now I'm out of place and I'm not getting any wiser
I feel like the sundance kid behind the synthesizer
And I tried last night to pack away the laugh
Like a key under the mat
But it never seems to be there when you want it
Black treacle
Black treacle
Black treacle
I wanna build you up (Brick by brick)
I wanna break you down (Brick by brick)
I'm gonna reconstruct (Brick by Brick)
I wanna feel you love
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
I wanna steal your soul (Brick by brick)
I wanna rock and roll (Brick byBrick)
I wanna rock and roll (Brick by brick)
I wanna rock and roll
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
I wanna brick by brick (Brick by brick)
I wanna blow by blow (Brick by brick)
I wanna an episode (Brick by brick)
I wanna brick by brick, by brick, by
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
Just when things are getting complicated
In the eye of the storm
She flicks a red hot revelation
Off the tip of her tongue
It does a dozen summersaults
And leaves you supercharged
Makes me wanna blow the candles out
Just to see if you glow in the dark
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Home sweet home
Home sweet home
Home sweet booby trap
I took the batteries out my mysticism
And put them in my thinking cap
She's got a telescopic hallelujah
Hanging up on the wall
For when it gets too complicated
In the eye of the storm
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
And in a Hellcat-spangled cavern
When your judgement's on the run
And you're acting like a stranger
 'Cause you thought it looked like fun
And did you ever get the feeling
That these are things she's said before
Her steady hands may well have done
The Devil's pedicure
What you waiting for
Sing another fucking shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Shalalala
Break a mirror
Roll the dice
Run with scissors
Through a chip pan fire fight
Go into business with a grizzly bear
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair
Find a well known hardman
And start a fight
Wear your shell suit
On bonfire night
Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
But just don't sit down 'causeI've moved your chair
Ooh...Yeah yeah yeah
Bite the lightning
And tell me how it tastes
KungFu fighting
On your roller skates
Do the macarena in the devils lair
But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair
Ooh...Yeah yeah yeah
I'm in a vest
Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of it's kind to get to the moon
Trust some ellipses to chase you round the room
Through curly straws and metaphors and goo!
Been watching all the neon blossom flickering
You look as if you've all forgotten where you've been
Going riding through the thunder suckle fuzz canyon
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4
3, 2, 1
Library pictures of the quickening canoe
The first of it's kind to get to the moon
Give me an eanie, meanie, minie, mo
Or an ip, dip, dog, shit, rock and roll
Caricatures of your wrecking ball gown
In my mind all the time
I wanna be in that damsel patterned alley
Where you go for a smoke
And sorrow slow dances
The phones are lighting up
Taking no chances
Close but never close enough
Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves
All my own stunts
High noon has changed it's tune
Linking arms, sinking hearts
And sorrow slow dances
Around the edges of her eyes
Taking no chances
The last one out to win a prize
Been watching cowboy films
On gloomy afternoons
Tinting the solitude
Put on your dancing shoes
And show me what to do
I know you've got the moves
'Cause I'm from HighGreen, I'm from HighGreen
Topless models doing semaphore
Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored
Illuminations on a rainy day
When she walks, her footsteps sing a reckless serenade
I've been trying to figure out exactly what it isI need
Call up to listen to the voice of reason
And got the answering machine
The type of kisses where teeth collide
When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun-gun lullaby
Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes
Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by
I've been trying to figure out exactly what it isI need
Call up to listen to the voice of reason
And got his answering machine
I left my message, but did he fuck get back to me
And nowI'm stuck, still wondering how it's meant to be
Singing a reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade, reckless serenade
Reckless serenade
I etched a face of a stopwatch
On the back of a raindrop
And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass
I heard an unhappy ending
It sort of sounds like you leaving
I heard the piledriver waltz
It woke me up this morning
You look like you've been for breakfast
At the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth
By the pamphlets and the literature
On how to lose
Your waitress was miserable
And so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes
Mystery's flashing amber
Go green when you answer
But the red on the rest of the questionnaire
Never changes
I heard the news that you're planning
To shoot me out of a cannon
I heard the piledriver waltz
It woke me up this morning
You look like you've been for breakfast
At the heartbreak hotel
And sat in the back booth
By the pamphlets and the literature
On how to lose
Your waitress was miserable
And so was your food
If you're gonna try and walk on water
Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes
Ohh, piledriver
Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
Or darling have you started feeling old yet?
Don't worry I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness
And do you still think love is a laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously?
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make believe
And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or has somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?
When I'm not being honest I pretend that you were just some lover
Now I can't think of her without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
For a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover
When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
Singing dreadful songs about summer
Will I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover?
Will I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover?
Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss it could put creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
And those other girls are just postmix lemonade
Suck it and see you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you
I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt girl that's a sawn off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me
Suck it and see you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you
Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart"
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Go, go, go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you
A pussyfooting setting sun
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles for you to hold
And no understanding where it goes
Jealousy in technicolor
Fear by name, love by numbers
Streetlamp amber, wanderlust
Powder in a blunderbuss
She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the skies are sizzling
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time's got it in for honey
That's where you're wrong
All the old flames fastened on
Make a wish that weighs a tonne
There are no handles that you can hold
And no understanding where it goes
She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the skies are sizzling
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time's got it in for honey
That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong
That's where you're wrong
