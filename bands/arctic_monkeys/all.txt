Stop making the eyes at me; 
I’ll stop making the eyes at you
What it is that surprises me, 
Is that I don't really want you to
When your shoulders are frozen (cold in the night)
Oh but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, 
ba-ba bang go

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you’re looking for romance or...
I don't know what you’re looking for
Well I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984, 
from 1984

I wish you'd stop ignoring me, 
because you're sending me to despair
Without a sound yeah you’re calling me, 
and I don't think it's very fair
That your shoulders are frozen (cold in the night)
Oh but you’re an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, 
ba-ba bang go

I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you’re looking for romance or...
I don't know what you’re looking for
Well I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984, 
from 1984

Oh there ain't no love
No Montagues or Capulets
We're just banging tunes and DJ sets and
Dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness

Well I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you’re looking for romance or...
I don't know what you’re looking for
I said that I bet 
that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984, 
from 1984

Fake Tales of San Francisco
Echo through the room
More point to a wedding disco
Without a bride or groom

There's a super cool band yeah
With their trilbys and their glasses of white wine
And all the weekend rock stars in the toilets
Practicing their lines

I don't want to hear you
(Kick me out, kick me out)
I don't want to hear you no
(Kick me out, kick me out)

Fake Tales of San Francisco
Echo through the air
And there's a few bored faces in the back
All wishing they weren't there

And as the microphone squeaks
A young girl's telephone beeps
Yeah she's dashing for the exit
she's running to the streets outside
"Oh you've saved me," she screams down the line
"The band weren’t very good
And I'm not having a nice time”

Yeah but his bird thinks it's amazing, though
So all that's left
Is the proof that love's not only blind but deaf

He talks of San Francisco, he's from Hunter's Bar
I don't quite know the distance
But I'm sure that's far
I'm sure that's pretty far

I'd love to tell you all my problem
You're not from New York City, you're from Rotherham
So get off the bandwagon, and put down the handbook

Get off the bandwagon and put down the handbook

Get on your dancing shoes
There's one thing on your mind
Hoping they’re looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging' through

And the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Oh, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
don't you always do the same
It's what you there for, don't you know

…the lights are flashing
Down in here tonight
And some might exchange a glance
But keep pretending to dance

Don't act like it's not happening
As if it’s impolite
To go and mention your name
Instead you'll just do the same
As they all do, and hope for the best...

The only reason that you came
So what you scared for?
Well don't you always do the same
It's what you’re there for but no

Get on your dancing shoes
You sexy little swine
Hoping they’re looking for you
Sure you'll be rummaging through

Oh and the shit, shock, horror
You've seen your future bride
Oh, but it's oh so absurd
For you to say the first word
So you're waiting and waiting 

One look sends it coursing through the veins 
oh how the feeling races
Back up to their brains to form 
expressions on there stupid faces
They don't want to say hello
Like I want to say hello
Oh the heartbeats at its peak 
when you're coming up to speak

And I'm so tense, never tenser
Could all go a bit Frank Spencer?
I'm talking gibberish, tip of the tongue 
but I can't deliver it
...Properly, oh it’s all getting on top of me
And if it weren't this dark 
you'd see how red my face has gone

Everybody's trying to crack the jokes 
and that to make you smile
Those that claim that 
they're not showing off are drowning in denial
They're not half as bad 
as me say anything and I'll agree
When it comes to acting up, 
I'm sure I could write the book

And now that you’re more than a part in the play
It’s slightly easier to think what to say
You had us all, standing on our heads
Doing our best tricks

Never again, will there be another one 
that's as desirable as you 

It’s ever so funny, 
I don’t think you’re special 
I don’t think you’re cool
You’re just probably alreyt, 
but under these lights you look beautiful
But I’m struggling, 
I can’t see through your fake tan
And you know it for a fact 
that everybody’s eating out of your hands

What do you know?
you know nothing
But I'll still take you home

Fancy seeing you in here, 
you're all tarted up and you don't look the same
I haven't seen you since last year 
and surprisingly you have forgot my name
But you know it and you knew it all along
Oh you say you have forgotten, 
but you're fibbing go on tell me I'm wrong
I fancy you with a passion, 
you're a Topshop princess, a rockstar too
You’re a fad you’re a fashion 
and I’m having a job trying to talk to you
But it's alright, put it all on one-side,
everybody's looking, 
you’ve got control of everyone's eyes
Including mine

Up rolled the riot van
And sparked excitement in the boys
But the policemen look annoyed
Perhaps these are ones they should avoid

They got a chase last night from men 
with truncheon’s dressed in hats
They didn’t do that much wrong, 
still ran away though for the laugh

“Please just stop talking
Because they won’t find us if you do
Oh those silly boys in blue
Well they won’t catch me and you”

“Have you been drinking son, 
you don’t look old enough to me”
“I’m sorry officer is there a certain age 
you’re supposed to be?… nobody told me”

Up rolled the riot van
And these lads just wind the coppers up
Ask why they don’t catch proper crooks
Get their address and their name’s took
But they couldn’t care less

He got thrown in the riot van
And all the coppers kicked him in
And there was no way he could win
Just had to take it on the chin 

Ask if we can have six in, 
if not we'll have to have 2
You're coming up our end aren't you? 
So I'll get one with you
Oh won't he let us have six in? 
especially not with the food
He coulda just told us no though, 
he dint have to be rude

See her in the green dress? 
She talked to me at the bar
How come its already two pound fifty? 
We've only gone about a yard
Dint ya see she were gorgeous, 
she was beyond belief
But this lad at the side 
drinking a Smirnoff ice 
came and paid for her tropical Reef

And I'm sitting going backwards, 
and I didn't want to leave
Its high green mate, via hillsborough please

How funny was that sketch earlier, 
up near that taxi rank
Oh no you will have missed it, 
think it was when you went to the bank
These two lads squaring up proper shouting, 
bout who was next in the queue 
The kind of thing 
that would seem so silly 
but not when they've both had a few

Calm down temper temper, 
you shouldn't get so annoyed
You_re acting like a silly little boy
They wanted to be men 
and do some fighting in the street
No surrender, no chance of retreat

Drunken plots hatched to jump it, 
ask around are ya sure?
Went for it but the red light was showing
And the red light indicates doors are secured

Now then Mardy Bum
I see your frown
And it's like looking down the barrel of a gun
And it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer

It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today 
when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Well now then Mardy Bum
Oh I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bear

Can't we laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today 
when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on

Yeah I'm sorry I was late
Well I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
That reoccurs, oh when you say I don't care
Well of course I do, yeah I clearly do!

So laugh and joke around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen
Yeah, to get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Still it's right hard to remember
That on a day like today 
when you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on 

I’ve seen your eyes as they fix on me 
what is he doing what on earth is the
Plan has he got one
You better give me some pointers 
since you are the big rocket launcher and
I'm just the shot gun,
I aint got no dollar signs in my eyes 
that might be a surprise but its true
I'm not like you and I don't want
your advice or your praise or to move in
The ways you do

All you people are vampires
All your stories are stale
Though you pretend to stand by us
Though you're certain we'll fail

I've seen you're eyes as they fix on me 
full of confusion your snarl is just
So condescending
Trying to explain 
that we're on to a win 
if the fee we get in near recoups
What we're spending
He said I can't believe 
that you drove all 
that way well how much did they
Pay ya how much did they pay ya, 
you'd have been better to stay round our way
Thinking about things 
but not actually doing things 

Who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong
So that she had to roam the streets
She dunt do major credit cards
I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate

And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes,
That he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences

And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
It’s all infected but he'll be alright
Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know
I said he's a scumbag, don't you know!

Although you're trying not to listen
Overt your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
“Sorry love I'll have to turn you down”

He must be up to something
What are the chances sure it’s more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
I start to wonder what his story might be

They said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here

Look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous?
And he don't have to say 'owt
She’s in the stance ready to get picked up

Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily clad beneath the clear night sky
It doesn't stop in the winter, no
Around here

They said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river going out of town

What a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all 

Last night these two bouncers
And one of em's alright
The other one's the scary one
His way or no way, totalitarian
He's got no time for you
Looking or breathing
How he dosen’t want you to
So step out the queue
He makes examples of you
And there's nowt you can say
Behind they go through to the bit where you pay
And you realize then that it's finally the time
To walk back past ten thousand eyes in the line
And you can swap jumpers and make another move
Instilled in your brain you've got something to prove
To all the smirking faces and the boys in black
Why can't they be pleasant?
Why can't they have a laugh?
He's got his hand in your chest
He wants to give you a duff
Well secretly I think they want it all to kick off
They want, arms flying everywhere and
Bottles as well it's just
Something to talk about
A story to tell you

Well I'm so glad they turned us 
all away we'll put it down to fate

I thought a thousand million things 
that I could never think this morning

Got too deep, but how deep is too deep?

This town's a different town today
This town's a different town to what it was last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday

That girl's a different girl today
That girl's a different girl 
to her you kissed last night
You couldn't have done that on a Sunday

Last night what we talked about
It made so much sense
But now the haze has ascended
It don't make no sense anymore

Well oh they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there isn’t no romance around there

And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see them, 
then you would agree
Agree that there isn’t no romance around there

It's a funny thing you know
We'll tell them if you like
We'll tell them all tonight
They'll never listen
Cause their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way

Over there there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it doesn’t take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here

Don't get me wrong though there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap 
with pool cues in their hands
And just cause he's had a couple of cans
He thinks it's alright to act like a dickhead

Well over there there's friends of mine
What can I say, 
I've known them for a long long time
And they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way
Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there’ll be some love
Tonight there’ll be a rawkus, 
regardless of what’s gone before
I want to see all of the things 
that we’ve already seen
The lairy girls hung out 
the window of the limousine
And of course its fancy dress
And they’re all looking quite full on
In bunny ears and devil horns

I want to see all of the things 
that we’ve already seen
I want to see you take the jackpot 
out the fruit machine
And put it all back in
You’ve got to understand it 
you can never beat the bandit

And she won’t be surprised 
and she won_t be shocked
When she’s pressed the star 
after she_s pressed unlock
And there’s verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that it says is 
that you’ve drank a lot
You should bear that in mind tonight
You can pour your heart out 
but her reasoning will block
owt you send her after nine o clock

You can pour your heart out around 3 o clock
When the 2 for 1’s undone the writers block 

Sat at the side of the pool 
at one of your houses 
with wet white trousers on
And worlds collide as the evening 
continues the dignity fucks off
Her brothers gone off to the strippers
 to make up for all the lost time
She could have been one of the bitches 
but she’s actually alright

Cigarette smoker, 
im sorry but we’re all unsure, 
how much you’ve had but we think 
that you ought to maybe not have anymore

A country home even 
if we really tried wouldn’t 
cease to surprise us now
And bet your dad would like 
to give us all a slap 
when are your parents back d’you know?
I never came from no ghetto 
but it wasn’t nowhere near here
Well spoken girls and stilettos, 
aren’t something to fear

Cigarette smoker, 
cigarette smoke doesn’t hide 
as well as you think and you’d think 
that it ought to act as the perfect disguise 

He's pining for her
In a people carrier
There might be buildings 
and pretty things to see like that
But architecture won't do
Although it might say a lot about the city or town
I don't care 
what they've got keep on turning them down
It don't say the funny things she does
Don't even try and cheer him up, because
It just won't happen

He's got the feeling again
This time on the aeroplane
There might be tellys 
in the back of the seats in front
But Rodney and Del won't do
Although it might 
take your mind off the aches and the pains
Laugh when he falls through the bar
But you're feeling the same
'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand
She won't be waiting for you when you land

It feels like she's just nowhere near
You could well be out on your ear
This thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thought of it
Makes you feel a bit
I'll

Yesterday I saw a girl
Who looked like someone 
you might knock about with
And almost shouted
And then reality kicked in within us
It seems as we become the winners
You lose a bit of summat
And half wonder if you won it at all

And don't say 'owt 'cause you've got no idea
And she's still nowhere near
And the thought comes closely 
followed by the fear
And the thought of it
Makes you feel a bit
...I'll

Despair in the departure lounge
It's one and they'll still be around at three
No signal and low battery
What's happened to me 

Lady where has your love gone? 
i was looking 
but can’t find it anywhere
They always offer 
when there’s loads of love around 
but when you’re short of some 
it’s nowhere to be found

I know your game, 
you told him yesterday “no chance, 
you’ll get nothing from me” 
but now she’s there, 
you’re there and every 
Body’s there and he’s i 
turmoil as puzzled as can be, 
just like me

Lets go down, low down 
where i know i should not go
She thinks she’s the one 
but she’s just one in 24
And just because everybody’s doing it doe 
that mean that i can too

Lady where has your love gone? 
it was the antiseptic to the sore
To hold you by the hand 
must he first be in demand? 
how he longs for you to long for him once more

Her eyes went down and cut you up, 
there’s nothing like a dirty look from…
The one you want or the one you lost

And ache in your soul it's everybody’s goal 
to get what they can’t have
That’s why you’re after her and 
that’s why she’s after him 
but saying it won’t change a thing
Realising it won’t change a thing. 

We all want some one to shout for
Everyone wants somebody to adore
Your heroes aren’t what they seem
When you’ve been where we’ve been

Have i done something to trigger…
The funny looks and the snigger?
Are they there at all…
Or is it just paranoia

Everybody’s got there box 
and are doing what they’re told
You push my faith near being lost 
but we’ll stick to the guns
Don’t care if its marketing suicide, 
we won’t crack or compromise, 
your derisory devides will never unhinge us

There’s a couple of hundred
Think they’re Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled here 
long before you

Just because we’re having a say so
And not lining up to be play doh
In five years time will it be; 
who the fuck’s arctic monkeys?

All the thoughts that i just said
Linger round and multiply in the head
Not that bad to start with,
I’m not angry, I’m just disappointed
Top marks for not trying
So I'd like you to bless us with your effortlessness
We'd wait for and so trained and comforted

And I wonder
Are you putting us under
'Cos we can't take our eyes off his t-shirt
And ties combination

Well see ya later Innovator!

Some want to kiss some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cos you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet, but she's yours

She'll be sayin' "Use me"
Show me the Jacuzzi
I imagine that it's there on a plate
you're our rendevouz rate
Means you'll never be frightnened
To make em wait for a while
I doubt it's your style
Not to get what you set
Out to acquire
The eyes are on fire
You are the un-forcasted storm

Calm, Collected and Commanding
(Top marks for not trying)
You hit the other story standing
With your ambitions and jokes
I bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cos you've stolen their...

Thunder
Are you putting us under
'Cos we can't take our eyes of his t-shirt
and ties combination

Well see ya later
Innovator

Despair to the point till they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
The sheer desperation to be scene/seen
Staring at the television screen

Despair to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline 
before you have told the joke
Sorry sunshine it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the top 100 list

And it's the thousandth time and it's even bolder,
Don't be surprised when you get bent over,
He told ya, that you were gagging for it

She saw it and she grabbed it 
and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
D'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
D'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath?
That says "we are defenders
Of any poseur or professional pretender around"

When did your list replace the twist and turn?
Ah the fist, replaced the kissed-on concern
And if you're bothered, I don't want your prayers
Save it for the morning after

And it's the thousandth time and it's even bolder,
Don't be surprised when you get bent over,
He told ya, that you were gagging for it

Lets have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker
Lets have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker

Asuming that all things are equal,
Who'd want to be men of the people
When there's people like you? 

He knew what he wanted to say
But he did not want to word it
The dirty little Herbert
Was thinking an escape
But the place was well guarded

The guiltyness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

D is for Delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know 
you're his favourite worst nightmare
D is for...

Desperately trying to stimulate 
what it was that was alright
3 quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
And every compromission
Another freak episode

He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps 
could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps 
could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps 
could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel
I think you should know 
you're his favourite worst nightmare

D is for delightful
and try and keep your trousers on
you should know 
you're his favourite worst nightmare

Running off over next doors garden
Before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling
Than it is a question of fun
The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks
And runny makeup alone

Or will blood run down the face
Of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish
And you wish you'd never been born
And you tie yourself to the tracks
And there isn't no going back
And it's wrong wrong wrong
But we'll do it anyway 
cause we love a bit of trouble

Are you pulling her from a burning building
Or throwing her to the sharks
Can only hope that the ending 
is as pleasurable as the start
The confidence is the balaclava, 
i'm sure you baffle 'em straight
And its wrong wrong wrong, she can hardly wait

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this....
Crime!

That's right, he wont let her out his sight
That's right, he wont let her out his sight
That's right, he wont let her out his sight

You'll be able to post any day of the most
For the sights of all time

You knew that it'd be trouble right 
before the very first kiss
Quiet and assuming 
but you heard that they were the naughtiest
She pleaded with you to take it off
But you resisted and fought
Sorry sweetheart, 
I'd much rather keep on the balaclava

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking a Tabasco
Remember when he used to be a rascal?

Oh that boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory and those dreams
Not as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem
My love when you dream them up...

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she tells she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget i
Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
Was it a megadobber or a betting pencil?

Oh that boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem
My love when you dream them up
Oh, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go? Woah.

Falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You just sounded it out
You're not coming back again.

Falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You just sounded it out
You're not coming back again.

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Started all the naughty nights with niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Everything was pretty in the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in tabasco
Remember when he used to be a rascal?

In a foreign place, 
the saving grace was the feeling,
That it was a heart that he was stealing,
Oh he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement,
The eyes are bright he couldnt wait to get away,
I bet the juliet was just the icing on the cake,
Make no mistake no,

And even if somehow we could have shown 
you the place you wanted,

Well I'm sure you could have made it 
that bit better on your own,
And I bet she told a million people 
that she'd stay in touch,
Well all the little promises 
they dont mean much,
When theres memories to be made,
And I hope you're holding hands by new years eve,
They made it far too easy to believe,
That true romance cant be acheived these days,

And even if somebody could have shown 
you the place you wanted,
Well I sure you could have made it 
that bit better on your own,
You are the only ones who know

Well the morning was complete.
There was tears on the steering wheel 
dripping on the seat,
Several hours or several weeks,
I'd have the cheek to say 
they're equally as bleak!

It's the beginning of the end, 
the car went up the hill,
And disappeared around the bend, 
ask anyone they'll tell you that.
It's these times that it tends,
The start to breaking up, 
to start to fall apart
Oh! hold on to your heart.

Do me a favour, break my nose!
Do me a favour, tell me to go away!
Do me a favour, stop asking questions!

She walked away, well her shoes were untied,
And the eyes were all red,
You could see that we've cried, 
and I watched and I waited,
'Till she was inside, 
forcing a smile and waving goodbye.

Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold.
Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold.

And do me a favour, 
and ask if you need some help!
She said, do me a favour 
and stop flattering yourself!
How to tear apart the ties that bind, 
perhaps fuck off, might be too kind,
Perhaps fuck off, might be too kind

This house is a circus, berserk as fuck
We tend to see that as a perk though. Look
What it's done to your friends 
their memories are pretend
And the last thing they 
want is for the feeling to end

What it's done to your friends

And the last thing

Looking for trouble and there's lovers to be had
Those ones next to us are such lovely lads
Scaling the corridors for maidens in the maze
And the anomaly is slipping into familiar ways
And we're forever unfulfilled
Can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes
Forever unfulfilled
And can't think why
Like a search for murder clues
In dead man's eyes

The more you open your mouth
The more you're forcing performance
All the attention is leading me 
to feel important (completely obnoxious)
Now that we're here, 
we may as well go too far

Wriggling around just so that you won't forget
There's certainly some venom 
in the looks that you collect
Aimlessly gazing at the blazers in the queue
Struggling with the notion 
that it's life not film

If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinchers
Three hundred and fifty no 
thank yous and nobody flinches
Go on girl go on, give us something gruesome
We require your grief, 
the thugs help the thieves
As they're trying to rob the words 
from her gob and
Take the source of the innocents

If you were there, beware
The serpent soul pinchers
Can't you sense she was never meant
To fill column inches
And you've had enough, 
what you're trying to dig up
Isn't there to be dug, 
the thieves help the thugs
As they're trying beat 
the good grace of a sweetheart

Out to the point she'll comply

Why leave her on her own
If I'd have known then 
I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it 
if I would have known
Why leave her on her own
If I predicted tears 
then I wouldn't have said it
I wouldn't have said it

There's a circle of witches, 
ambitiously vicious they are
Our attempts to remind them 
of reason won't get us that far
I don't know what it is that they want
I don't know what it is that they want
But I haven't got it to give
She hasn't got it to give

Do the bad thing,
Take off your wedding ring,
But it wont make it that much easier, 
it might make it worse,

Oh the nights like a whirlwind,
Somebody's girlfriend's talkin' to me 
but its alright,
She's sayin that hes not gonna slap me 
or try to attack me,
Hes not the jealous type,
And I ony need to get half an excuse and im away,
But when theres no excuses 
thats much easier to say,
I've been before,
And all these capers make her too forward to ignore,
Well She's talkin but im not entirely sure, ohh

Do the bad thing,
Take off your wedding ring,
But it wont make it that much easier, 
it might make it worse,

Oh im stood at the bar 
and somebody's partner's talkin to me,
But I dont know that is 
what she isnt she murmors things to confirm 
That the tragedy is true,
And I knew 'how could she could have anyone she wants,
And im strugglin to think of an immediate response,

Like I dont mind,
Be a big mistake,
For you to wait,
And let me waste your time,
Really love its fine,
Really love its fine,

And then the first time it occured 
that there was something to destroy,

I knew before the invitation 
that there was this ploy,
Oh but she carried on suggestin, 
a struggle to refuse,
She said "its the red wine this time, 
but that is no excuse"

Old yellow bricks,
Love's a risk,
Quite the little Escapoligist
Looked so miffed,
When you wished,
For a thousand places better than this,

You are the fugitive,
But you dont know what you're runnin from,
You cant kid us,
And you couldnt trick anyone,
Houdini, love you dont know 
what you're runnin away from,

Who wants to sleep in the city 
that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia,
Who wants to sleep in the city 
that never wakes up?

She wasnt raised by the way,
That the emperor put traps in the cage,
And the days she being dull,
Lead to nights readin beer bottles,

You're such a fugitive,
But you dont know what you're runnin from,
You cant kid us,
And you couldnt trick anyone,
Houdini, love you dont know 
what you're runnin away from,

Who wants to sleep in the city 
that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia,
Who wants to sleep in a city 
that never wakes up?

You're at a loss,
Just because,
It wasnt all that you thought it was,

You are a fugitive but you dont know 
what you're runnin away from,

She said I want to sleep in the city 
that never wakes up,
And revel in nostalgia,
I know I said he wants to sleep in the city 
that never wakes up but,
Dorothy was right though

I'm going back to 505,
If its a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive,
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side,
With your hands between your thighs,

Stop and wait a sec,
Oh when you look at me like that my darling,
What did you expect,
I probably still adore you
with you hand around my neck,
Or I did last time I checked,

Not shy of a spark,
A knife twists at the thought 
that I should fall short of the mark,
Frightened by the bite though 
its no harsher than the bark,
Middle of adventure, 
such a perfect place to start,

I'm going back to 505,
If its a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive,
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side,
With your hands between your thighs,

But I crumble completely when you cry,
It seems like once again 
you've had to greet me with goodbye,
Im always just about to go and spoil a suprise,
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon,

I'm going back to 505,
If its a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive,
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side,
With your hands between your thighs and a smile
Top marks for not trying
So I'd like you to bless us with your effortlessness
We'd wait for and so trained and comforted

And I wonder
Are you putting us under
'Cos we can't take our eyes off his t-shirt
And ties combination

Well see ya later Innovator!

Some want to kiss some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cos you're smooth and you're wet
And she's not aware yet, but she's yours

She'll be sayin' "Use me"
Show me the Jacuzzi
I imagine that it's there on a plate
you're our rendevouz rate
Means you'll never be frightnened
To make em wait for a while
I doubt it's your style
Not to get what you set
Out to acquire
The eyes are on fire
You are the un-forcasted storm

Calm, Collected and Commanding
(Top marks for not trying)
You hit the other story standing
With your ambitions and jokes
I bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cos you've stolen their...

Thunder
Are you putting us under
'Cos we can't take our eyes of his t-shirt
and ties combination

Well see ya later
Innovator 
Top 

Despair to the point till they provoke
The punchline before they have told the joke
The sheer desperation to be scene/seen
Staring at the television screen

Despair to the point where they provoke
You to tell the fucking punchline 
before you have told the joke
Sorry sunshine it doesn't exist
It wasn't in the top 100 list

And it's the thousandth time and it's even bolder,
Don't be surprised when you get bent over,
He told ya, that you were gagging for it

She saw it and she grabbed it 
and it wasn't what it seemed
The kids all dream of making it, whatever that means
Another variation on a theme
A tangle on the television and the magazine
D'you reckon that they do it for a joke?
D'you reckon that they make 'em take an oath?
That says "we are defenders
Of any poseur or professional pretender around"

When did your list replace the twist and turn?
Ah the fist, replaced the kissed-on concern
And if you're bothered, I don't want your prayers
Save it for the morning after

And it's the thousandth time and it's even bolder,
Don't be surprised when you get bent over,
He told ya, that you were gagging for it

Lets have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker
Lets have a game on the Teddy Picker
Not quick enough can I have it quicker?
Already thick and you're getting thicker

Asuming that all things are equal,
Who'd want to be men of the people
When there's people like you? 

He knew what he wanted to say
But he did not want to word it
The dirty little Herbert
Was thinking an escape
But the place was well guarded

The guiltyness that started
Soon as the other part had stopped

D is for Delightful
And try and keep your trousers on
I think you should know 
you're his favourite worst nightmare
D is for...

Desperately trying to stimulate 
what it was that was alright
3 quarters of an hour ago
That had led him to be in a position
And every compromission
Another freak episode

He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps 
could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps 
could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel universe perhaps 
could be the perfect scene
He's nearing the brink but he thinks first
The parallel
I think you should know 
you're his favourite worst nightmare

D is for delightful
and try and keep your trousers on
you should know 
you're his favourite worst nightmare

Running off over next doors garden
Before the hour is done
It's more a question of feeling
Than it is a question of fun
The confidence is the balaclava
I'm sure you'll baffle 'em good
Will the ending reek of salty cheeks
And runny makeup alone

Or will blood run down the face
Of a boy bewildered and scorned
And you'll find yourself in a skirmish
And you wish you'd never been born
And you tie yourself to the tracks
And there isn't no going back
And it's wrong wrong wrong
But we'll do it anyway 
cause we love a bit of trouble

Are you pulling her from a burning building
Or throwing her to the sharks
Can only hope that the ending 
is as pleasurable as the start
The confidence is the balaclava, 
i'm sure you baffle 'em straight
And its wrong wrong wrong, she can hardly wait

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this crime?

That's right, he won't let her out his sight
Now the shaggers perform
And the daggers are drawn
Who's the crooks in this....
Crime!

That's right, he wont let her out his sight
That's right, he wont let her out his sight
That's right, he wont let her out his sight

You'll be able to post any day of the most
For the sights of all time

You knew that it'd be trouble right 
before the very first kiss
Quiet and assuming 
but you heard that they were the naughtiest
She pleaded with you to take it off
But you resisted and fought
Sorry sweetheart, 
I'd much rather keep on the balaclava

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking a Tabasco
Remember when he used to be a rascal?

Oh that boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory and those dreams
Not as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem
My love when you dream them up...

Flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she tells she's gonna get it
I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget i
Clinging to not getting sentimental
Said she wasn't going but she went still
Likes her gentlemen to not be gentle
Was it a megadobber or a betting pencil?

Oh that boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had
Is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem
My love when you dream them up
Oh, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go? Woah.

Falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You just sounded it out
You're not coming back again.

Falling about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You just sounded it out
You're not coming back again.

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Started all the naughty nights with niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in a black hole
Everything was pretty in the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in tabasco
Remember when he used to be a rascal?

In a foreign place, 
the saving grace was the feeling,
That it was a heart that he was stealing,
Oh he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement,
The eyes are bright he couldnt wait to get away,
I bet the juliet was just the icing on the cake,
Make no mistake no,

And even if somehow we could have shown 
you the place you wanted,

Well I'm sure you could have made it 
that bit better on your own,
And I bet she told a million people 
that she'd stay in touch,
Well all the little promises 
they dont mean much,
When theres memories to be made,
And I hope you're holding hands by new years eve,
They made it far too easy to believe,
That true romance cant be acheived these days,

And even if somebody could have shown 
you the place you wanted,
Well I sure you could have made it 
that bit better on your own,
You are the only ones who know

Well the morning was complete.
There was tears on the steering wheel 
dripping on the seat,
Several hours or several weeks,
I'd have the cheek to say 
they're equally as bleak!

It's the beginning of the end, 
the car went up the hill,
And disappeared around the bend, 
ask anyone they'll tell you that.
It's these times that it tends,
The start to breaking up, 
to start to fall apart
Oh! hold on to your heart.

Do me a favour, break my nose!
Do me a favour, tell me to go away!
Do me a favour, stop asking questions!

She walked away, well her shoes were untied,
And the eyes were all red,
You could see that we've cried, 
and I watched and I waited,
'Till she was inside, 
forcing a smile and waving goodbye.

Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, too heavy to hold.
Curiousity becomes a heavy load,
Too heavy to hold, will force you to be cold.

And do me a favour, 
and ask if you need some help!
She said, do me a favour 
and stop flattering yourself!
How to tear apart the ties that bind, 
perhaps fuck off, might be too kind,
Perhaps fuck off, might be too kind

I'm going back to 505,
If its a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive,
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side,
With your hands between your thighs,

Stop and wait a sec,
Oh when you look at me like that my darling,
What did you expect,
I probably still adore you
with you hand around my neck,
Or I did last time I checked,

Not shy of a spark,
A knife twists at the thought 
that I should fall short of the mark,
Frightened by the bite though 
its no harsher than the bark,
Middle of adventure, 
such a perfect place to start,

I'm going back to 505,
If its a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive,
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side,
With your hands between your thighs,

But I crumble completely when you cry,
It seems like once again 
you've had to greet me with goodbye,
Im always just about to go and spoil a suprise,
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon,

I'm going back to 505,
If its a 7 hour flight or a 45 minute drive,
In my imagination you're waiting lying on your side,
With your hands between your thighs and a smile
If you can summon the strength, tow me
I can't hold down the urgency
You've got to make your descent slowly
And oil up those sticky keys

[Chorus]
Coax me out my low
And have a spin of my propeller

[Verse 2]
It's a necessary evil
No cause for emergency
Borrowed the beak off a bald eagle
Oh, momentary synergy

[Chorus]
Coax me out my low
Sink into tomorrow
Coax me out my low
And have a spin of my propeller

[Outro]
My propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
Oh, my propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
Oh, my propeller won't spin
And I can't get it started on my own
When are you arriving?
Oh, my propeller

Outside the cafe by the cracker factory
You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, "You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before"
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste

[Chorus]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man
On rainy afternoons

[Verse 2]
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw

[Chorus]
And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting, but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are
Crying Lightning

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning
Crying Lightning, Crying Lightning
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called Crying

I'm pinned down by the dark

[Verse 1]
Been fighting with my sheets and nearly crying in my sleep
Yes, I'm battling that well-told gripe, the most frustrating type
You should have racing stripes the way you keep me in pursuit
Sharpen the heel of your boot and you press it in my chest
And you make me wheeze, then to my knees you do promote me

[Chorus]
ANIMAL
Makes my head pirouette
More than I would be willing to confess
DANGEROUS

[Verse 2]
The light it fidgets through, the thoughts'll soon revert to you
About as bashful as a tribal dance, the first and final chance
And of course the audience of frighteners and fiends
Divided up into two teams
When the acrobat fell off the beam, she broke everyone's heart

[Chorus]
I'm pinned down by the dark
ANIMAL
Makes my head pirouette
More than I would be willing to confess
DANGEROUS
DANGEROUS
The most unsuitable pet
It's been long enough now so let's
Make a mess, lioness

[Bridge]
I'm pinned down by the dark
I'm pinned down by the dark, oh-oh-oh

Fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
That you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares

[Verse 1]
She swam out of tonight's phantasm
Grabbed my hand and made it very clear
There's absolutely nothing for us here
It's a magnolia celebration to be attended on a Wednesday night
It's better that than get a reputation as a miserable little tyke
At least that's the conclusion she came to in this overture

[Bridge]
And the secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing, she's just giggling along

[Verse 2]
Her arms were folded most indignant
Not looking like she was soon to leave
I had to squint in order to believe
Then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
I'm unveiling the unexpected
I, who was earlier reluctant
Was suddenly embarrassed and corrected
How could such a creature survive in such a habitat?

[Bridge]
And the secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing, she's just giggling along
Even if they were to find us
I wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied

[Chorus]
As all the fools on parade cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
Ones you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares
Fools on parade frolic and fuck about to make her gaze
Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture that holds her absence
But you're daft to think she'd care

[Outro]
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Conduct a sing-along

I was biting the time zone
And we embellished the banks of our bloodstreams
And threw caution to the colourful
Then we fell asleep in the car
Until the bumps woke me up in your grip
And the tide took me to your mouth
And then swept me back down to your palms
It's them that put me inside the reminder
That yours is the only ocean

[Chorus]
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna hang on

[Verse 2]
I've got this ego mechanic
She's always trying to give me vitamins
Ah, she'd be frightened of your reflection
I preferred her as a cartoon
If I could be someone else for a week
I'd spend it chasing after you
'Cause she's not shattering my attitudes
No matter how she folds the potion
Yours is the only ocean

[Chorus]
Yours is the only ocean
That I wanna swing from
Yours is the only ocean
That I want to hang on to

[Bridge]
Potion approaching, shield your eyes
Potion approaching, visualise
Holding a token, swollen in size
Potion approaching, shield your eyes

[Outro]
Oh, but if we're gonna escape though
We really ought to think it through
Would you like me to build you a go-kart?

I thought I saw you in the Battleship
But it was only a look-a-like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name

[Verse 2]
I thought I saw you in the Rusty Hook
Huddled up in a wicker chair
I wandered over for a closer look
And kissed whoever was sitting there
She was close, and she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely
"Please, can I call you her name?"

[Chorus]
And I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

[Verse 3]
I thought I saw you in the Parrot's Beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in Letraset
"No, you can't call me her name"

[Bridge]
Tell me, where's your hiding place?
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along

[Chorus]
I elongated my lift home
Yeah, I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seatbelt
And kept my shortcuts to myself

[Verse 4]
I saw your sister in the Cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand
She was close, well, you couldn't get much closer
She said, "I'm really not supposed to, but yes
You can call me anything you want"

I heard the truth was built to bend
A mechanism to suspend
The guilt is what you will require
And still you've got to dance little liar
Just like those fibs to pop and fizz
And you'll be forced to take that awful quiz
And you're bound to trip
And she'll detect the fiction on your lips and dig a contradiction up

[Chorus]
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt
The liar takes a lot less time

[Verse 2]
I'm sure it's clear and plain to read
It's not an alibi you need just yet
Oh, no, it's something for those beads of sweat
Yes, that will get you back to normal
And after you have dabbed the patch
You'll breathe and then proceed to scratch
The varnish off that newly added calmness
So as not to raise any alarms too soon

[Chorus]
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt

[Bridge]
The liar takes a lot less time to decide on the saunter
Have you got itchy bones? And in all your time alone
Can you hack your mind being riddled
With the wrong memories?

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt between the dirt

Trudging through the morning
The tramp with the trampoline under his arm
Shifts past your whiskers, so stark is the charm
But the barking alarm waits coiled 'til the corner is turned
And the bicycle wheels all struggle to move 'round
In your muddy mind, blatantly caked and
Unwilling to wind uncooperative time
So he sits on the springs 'til the muck goes dry

[Chorus]
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the

[Verse 2]
What came first, the chicken or the dickhead?
Split sleep reaps rewards from ill fitting thoughts
And twilight forced you to go on a walk
Your legs start running and your leg gets caught
Canopy 19 is perfectly placed
For the reasonably frightening fall from the aftertaste
You'll have to slip away, I am unhappy to say
Behold as the crook in the hammock plays

[Chorus]
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

[Verse 3]
Behold as a crook in the hammock plays
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
Gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp
Cruelly with the base and the scales
And fucking fiddles with her feet on a balancing act
She was gagged, bound and crafting a tale
Trailing wrapped in a gasp

[Chorus]
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall

Fiendish wonder in a carnival's wake
Dull caresses once again irritate
Tread softly, stranger
Move over toward the danger that you seek
You think excitement has receded then the mirror distracts
The logic of the trance quickly reaches and grasps
Handsome and faceless
And weightless, your imagination runs

[Chorus]
And now it's no one's fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

[Verse 2]
In the moonlight they're more thrilling, those things that he knows
As he leads you through the grinning bubble blowers in the snow
Watching his exit
Was like falling off the ferry in the night
The inevitables gather to push you around
Any other voice makes such a punishing sound
He became laughter's assassin
Shortly after he showed you what it was

[Chorus]
And now it's no one's fault but yours
At the foot of the house of cards
You thought you'd never get obsessed
You thought the wolves would be impressed
And you're a sinking stone
But you know what it's like to hold the jeweller's hands
That procession of pioneers all drowned

[Outro]
If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach
Please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece, I can't calibrate
Let's get it ingrained

If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach
Please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece, I can't calibrate
Let's get it ingrained

If you've a lesson to teach me
I'm listening, ready to learn
There's no one here to police me
I'm sinking in until the return
If you've a lesson to teach
Please don't deviate, don't be afraid
Without the last corner piece, I can't calibrate
Let's get it ingrained

When I got back from fixing my hair
You were directing the traffic
Letting your story slip on the snow
As if the transmission was automatic
It's arguable that I shouldn't've been there
It was fortunate timing
I had a hole in the pocket of my favourite coat
And my love dropped into the lining

[Chorus]
(Have you got your strange?) Not on me
I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?) Not on me

[Verse 2]
You can't sleep until you've sat on the steps to weep
'Til you feel like you've wept, yeah
(As long as you don't forget your strange)

[Chorus]
(Have you got your strange?) No, not on me
I haven't got my strange
(Have you got your strange?) Not on me
I haven't got my strange
I've better fetch my strange
I haven't got my strange
I haven't got my strange
She's thunderstorms
 Lying on her front
 Up against the wall
 She's thunderstorms

 I've been feeling foolish
 You should try it
 She came and substituted
 The peace and quiet for
 Acrobatic blood flow
 Concertina cheating heart beat
 Rapid fire

 She's thunderstorms
 Lying on her front
 Up against the wall
 She's thunderstorms

 Here is your host
 Sounds as if she's pretty close
 When the heat starts growing horns
 She's thunderstorms

 She's been loop the looping
 Around my mind
 Her motorcycle boots give me
 This kind of acrobatic blood
 Concertina cheating heart beat
 Rapid fire

 She's thunderstorms
 Lying on her front
 Up against the wall
 She's thunderstorms
 In an unusual place
 When you're feeling far away
 She does what the night does to the day

 She's thunderstorms
 Lying on her front
 Up against the wall
 She's thunderstorms
 Thunderstorms
 Thunderstorms

Lately I've been seeing things
 Belly button piercings
 In the sky at night
 When we're side by side

 And I don't mean to rain on anybody's cabriolet
 One of those games you're gonna lose
 But you wanna play it just in case

 Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
 More like black treacle than tar
 Black treacle
 Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
 And so they found a place to hide

 Does it help you stay up late?
 Does it help you concentrate?
 Does it tune you in when you chew your chin?
 Am I ruining your fun?

 And you talk the talk alright
 But do you walk the walk or catch the train?
 You wanted it, you got it
 But you don't want it now

 Now it's getting dark and the sky looks sticky
 More like black treacle than tar
 Black treacle
 Somebody told the stars you're not coming out tonight
 And so they found a place to hide

 Now I'm out of place and I'm not getting any wiser
 I feel like the sundance kid behind the synthesizer
 And I tried last night to pack away the laugh
 Like a key under the mat
 But it never seems to be there when you want it

 Black treacle
 Black treacle
 Black treacle

I wanna build you up (Brick by brick)
 I wanna break you down (Brick by brick)
 I'm gonna reconstruct (Brick by Brick)
 I wanna feel you love

 Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
 Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)

 I wanna steal your soul (Brick by brick)
 I wanna rock and roll (Brick by Brick)
 I wanna rock and roll (Brick by brick)
 I wanna rock and roll

 Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
 Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)

 I wanna brick by brick (Brick by brick)
 I wanna blow by blow (Brick by brick)
 I wanna an episode (Brick by brick)
 I wanna brick by brick, by brick, by

 Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
 Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
 Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)
 Brick by brick (Ahhhhhh)

Just when things are getting complicated
 In the eye of the storm
 She flicks a red hot revelation
 Off the tip of her tongue
 It does a dozen summersaults
 And leaves you supercharged
 Makes me wanna blow the candles out
 Just to see if you glow in the dark

 Shalalala
 Shalalala
 Shalalala
 Shalalala

 Home sweet home
 Home sweet home
 Home sweet booby trap
 I took the batteries out my mysticism
 And put them in my thinking cap
 She's got a telescopic hallelujah
 Hanging up on the wall
 For when it gets too complicated
 In the eye of the storm

 Shalalala
 Shalalala
 Shalalala
 Shalalala

 And in a Hellcat-spangled cavern
 When your judgement's on the run
 And you're acting like a stranger
 'Cause you thought it looked like fun
 And did you ever get the feeling
 That these are things she's said before
 Her steady hands may well have done
 The Devil's pedicure
 What you waiting for
 Sing another fucking shalalala

 Shalalala
 Shalalala
 Shalalala

Break a mirror
 Roll the dice
 Run with scissors
 Through a chip pan fire fight
 Go into business with a grizzly bear
 But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

 Find a well known hardman
 And start a fight
 Wear your shell suit
 On bonfire night
 Fill in a circular hole with a peg that's square
 But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

 Ooh... Yeah yeah yeah [x2]

 Bite the lightning
 And tell me how it tastes
 Kung Fu fighting
 On your roller skates
 Do the macarena in the devils lair
 But just don't sit down 'cause I've moved your chair

 Ooh... Yeah yeah yeah

I'm in a vest

 Library pictures of the quickening canoe
 The first of it's kind to get to the moon
 Trust some ellipses to chase you round the room
 Through curly straws and metaphors and goo!

 Been watching all the neon blossom flickering
 You look as if you've all forgotten where you've been
 Going riding through the thunder suckle fuzz canyon
 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4
 3, 2, 1

 Library pictures of the quickening canoe
 The first of it's kind to get to the moon
 Give me an eanie, meanie, minie, mo
 Or an ip, dip, dog, shit, rock and roll

Caricatures of your wrecking ball gown
 In my mind all the time

 I wanna be in that damsel patterned alley
 Where you go for a smoke

 And sorrow slow dances
 The phones are lighting up
 Taking no chances
 Close but never close enough

 Been watching cowboy films
 On gloomy afternoons
 Tinting the solitude
 Put on your dancing shoes
 And show me what to do
 I know you've got the moves

 All my own stunts
 High noon has changed it's tune
 Linking arms, sinking hearts

 And sorrow slow dances
 Around the edges of her eyes
 Taking no chances
 The last one out to win a prize

 Been watching cowboy films
 On gloomy afternoons
 Tinting the solitude
 Put on your dancing shoes
 And show me what to do
 I know you've got the moves

 'Cause I'm from High Green, I'm from High Green

Topless models doing semaphore
 Wave their flags as she walks by and get ignored
 Illuminations on a rainy day
 When she walks, her footsteps sing a reckless serenade

 I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
 Call up to listen to the voice of reason
 And got the answering machine

 The type of kisses where teeth collide
 When she laughs, the heavens hum a stun-gun lullaby
 Those twinkling vixens with the shining spiral eyes
 Their hypnosis goes unnoticed when she's walking by

 I've been trying to figure out exactly what it is I need
 Call up to listen to the voice of reason
 And got his answering machine
 I left my message, but did he fuck get back to me
 And now I'm stuck, still wondering how it's meant to be
 Singing a reckless serenade, reckless serenade
 Reckless serenade, reckless serenade

 Reckless serenade, reckless serenade
 Reckless serenade

I etched a face of a stopwatch
 On the back of a raindrop
 And did a swap for the sand in an hourglass

 I heard an unhappy ending
 It sort of sounds like you leaving
 I heard the piledriver waltz
 It woke me up this morning

 You look like you've been for breakfast
 At the heartbreak hotel
 And sat in the back booth
 By the pamphlets and the literature
 On how to lose
 Your waitress was miserable
 And so was your food
 If you're gonna try and walk on water
 Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

 Mystery's flashing amber
 Go green when you answer
 But the red on the rest of the questionnaire
 Never changes

 I heard the news that you're planning
 To shoot me out of a cannon
 I heard the piledriver waltz
 It woke me up this morning

 You look like you've been for breakfast
 At the heartbreak hotel
 And sat in the back booth
 By the pamphlets and the literature
 On how to lose
 Your waitress was miserable
 And so was your food
 If you're gonna try and walk on water
 Make sure you wear your comfortable shoes

 Ohh, piledriver

Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
 Or darling have you started feeling old yet?
 Don't worry I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
 With the efficiency that only youth can harness

 And do you still think love is a laserquest
 Or do you take it all more seriously?
 I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
 But you're always busy being make believe

 And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
 Or has somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?
 When I'm not being honest I pretend that you were just some lover

 Now I can't think of her without thinking of you
 I doubt that comes as a surprise
 And I can't think of anything to dream about
 I can't find anywhere to hide
 And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
 And I convince myself I need another
 For a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover

 When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
 Singing dreadful songs about summer
 Will I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover?
 Will I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover?

Your love is like a studded leather headlock
 Your kiss it could put creases in the rain
 You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
 And those other girls are just postmix lemonade

 Suck it and see you never know
 Sit next to me before I go
 Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
 Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you

 I poured my aching heart into a pop song
 I couldn't get the hang of poetry
 That's not a skirt girl that's a sawn off shotgun
 And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me

 Suck it and see you never know
 Sit next to me before I go
 Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
 Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you

 Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
 How I often wonder where you are
 You have got that face that just says
 "Baby, I was made to break your heart"

 Suck it and see, you never know
 Sit next to me before I go
 Go, go, go
 Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
 Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you

A pussyfooting setting sun
 Make a wish that weighs a tonne
 There are no handles for you to hold
 And no understanding where it goes

 Jealousy in technicolor
 Fear by name, love by numbers
 Streetlamp amber, wanderlust
 Powder in a blunderbuss

 She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
 And suddenly the skies are sizzling
 Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
 Crushing up a bundle of love
 Don't take it so personally
 You're not the only one
 That time's got it in for honey
 That's where you're wrong

 All the old flames fastened on
 Make a wish that weighs a tonne
 There are no handles that you can hold
 And no understanding where it goes

 She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
 And suddenly the skies are sizzling
 Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
 Crushing up a bundle of love
 Don't take it so personally
 You're not the only one
 That time's got it in for honey
 That's where you're wrong
 That's where you're wrong
 That's where you're wrong
Do I Wanna Know?

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type that sticks around like something in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt it's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

Crawling back to you (crawling back to you)

Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (you've had a few)
'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)
Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy) busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through

Crawling back to you

(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways
(Sad to see you go)
Was sorta hoping that you'd stay
(Baby we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day

(Do I wanna know?)
Too busy being yours to fall
(Sad to see you go)
Ever thought of calling down?
(Do I wanna know?)
Do you want me crawling back to you?

R U Mine?

I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling diamond
Coulda shaped heartaches
Come to find ya fall in some velvet morning
Years too late
She's a silver lining lone ranger riding
Through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine? "

Are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine?

I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine? "

Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine? Mine?)

And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case I'm mistaken,
I just wanna hear you say you got me baby
Are you mine?

She's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me
And I go crazy cause here isn't where I wanna be

And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself,
All I wanna hear her say is "Are you mine? "

Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow, or just mine tonight?)

One For The Road

One for the road, ooh ooh
One for the road, ooh ooh

From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby, I feel like I've been in here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?

I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll

One for the road, ooh ooh

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby, I feel like I've been in here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?

The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster

Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road

So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby, I feel like I've been in here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go,
Will you pour me one for the road?

Arabella

Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
And a helter skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams

My days end best when this sunset gets itself
Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

Arabella's got a 70's head
But she's a modern lover
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the colour of a constellation falling into place

My days end best when this sunset gets itself
Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes

As Arabella
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

That's magic in a cheetah print coat
Just a slip underneath it I hope
Asking if I can have one of those
Organic cigarettes that she smokes
Wraps her lips round the Mexican coke
Makes you wish that you were the bottle
Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like...

Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure

I Want It All

Blind faith
Heartache
Mind games
Mistakes
My sweet fireball
My sweet rigmarole
I want it all
I want it all

Old dogs
New tricks
Can you feel it?
Space age country girl
Stone cold miracle
I want it all
I want it all

And then suddenly it hit me it's a year ago
Since I drank miniature whiskey and we shared your coke
Ain't it just like you to kiss me and then hit the road
Leave me listening to The Stones
2000 Light Years From Home

No.1 Party Anthem

So you're on the prowl wondering whether she left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles

Call off the search for your soul, or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this her oldest friends
Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem

She's a certified mind blower, knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which you might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love I just want you to do me no good
And you look like you could

[Chorus x2]

The look of love - the rush of blood
The "She's with me" - the Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs - the Camera Plus
The black & white - the colour dodge
The good time girl - the cubicles
The house of fun - the number one party anthem

Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem

Mad Sounds

Mad sounds in your ears, they make you feel alright
They bring you back to life
Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
They make you get up
Yeah they make you get up

Love buckles under the strain of those wild nights
Run but you cannot hide
Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance
They make you get up
All night long they reappear
They make you get up and dance
Yeah they make you get up

Suppose you've gotta do what you gotta do
We just weren't feeling how we wanted to
You sit and try sometimes but you just can't figure out what went wrong
Then out of nowhere somebody comes and hits you with an
Ooh la la la la...

(Ooh la la la la...)
You got those mad sounds in your ears to make you get up and dance
Mad sounds in your ears, they make you get up and dance

Fireside

I can't explain but I want to try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time

There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite and you lived there so long,
It's kinda strange now you're gone

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside

There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same
But something about it's changed

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside

And I thought I was yours forever
Maybe I was mistaken but I just cannot manage to make it through the day
Without thinking of you lately

I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside

Why'd You Only Call Me When You're High?

The mirror's image
Tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished
'Cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leaving
Carrying your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreaming
Of bumping into you

Now it's three in the morning and I'm tryna change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply
Why'd you only call me when you're high?
High, why'd you only call me when you're high?

Somewhere darker
Talking the same shite
I need a partner
Well, are you out tonight?
Gets harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of making alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Now it's three in the morning and I'm tryna change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls and to my message you reply (message you reply)
Why'd you only call me when you're high? (Why'd you only call me when you're high?)
High, why'd you only call me when you're high?

And I can't see you here wondering where am I?
Sorta feels like I'm running out of time
I haven't found what I was hoping to find
You said you gotta be up in the morning, gonna have an early night
And you're starting to bore me, baby
Why'd you only call me when you're high?

Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?
Why'd you only ever phone me when you're high?

Snap Out Of It

What's been happening in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love
Or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth...

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settling down or giving up
But it don't sound much like you girl

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Under a spell you're hypnotized
Darling how could you be so blind?
(Snap out of it)
Under a spell you're hypnotized
Darling how could you be so blind?

I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it

Knee Socks

You got the lights on in the afternoon
And the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissing to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop coloured tongue
And you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

Well you cured my January blues
Yeah you made it all alright
I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse
That you were trying not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was acting like I knew
'Cause I had nothing to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
Ain't it funny what you'll do

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks

The late afternoon
The ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
Knee socks

You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could Be My Baby
[x4]

(All the zeros lined up but the number's blocked when you've come undone)

When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
[x2]

I Wanna Be Yours

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I won't ever rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots babe
I just wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours

Let me be your 'leccy meter and I'll never run out
And let me be the portable heater that you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (I wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours

Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours...

I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I won't ever rust
I just wanna be yours
I just wanna be yours
I just wanna be yours
I just wanted to be one of The Strokes
Now look at the mess you made me make
Hitchhiking with a monogrammed suitcase
Miles away from any half-useful imaginary highway
I'm a big name in deep space, ask your mates
But golden boy's in bad shape
I found out the hard way that
Here ain't no place for dolls like you and me
Everybody's on a barge
Floating down the endless stream of great TV
1984, 2019

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Rocket-ship grease down the cracks of my knuckles
Karate bandana, warp speed chic
Hair down to there, impressive moustache
Love came in a bottle with a twist-off cap
Let's all have a swig and do a hot lap

[Chorus]
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Baby, that isn't how they look tonight, oh no
It took the light forever to get to your eyes

[Verse 2]
I just wanted to be one of those ghosts
You thought that you could forget
And then I haunt you via the rear view mirror
On a long drive from the back seat
But it's alright, 'cause you love me
And you recognise that it ain't how it should be
Your eyes are heavy and the weather's getting ugly
So pull over, I know the place
Don't you know an apparition is a cheap date?
What exactly is it you've been drinking these days?
Jukebox in the corner, "Long Hot Summer"
They've got a film up on the wall and it's dark enough to dance
What do you mean you've never seen Blade Runner?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, maybe I was a little too wild in the '70s
Back down to earth with a lounge singer shimmer
Elevator down to my make-believe residency
From the honeymoon suite
Two shows a day, four nights a week
Easy money

[Chorus]
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
So who you gonna call?
The Martini Police
Oh, baby, that isn't how they look tonight
It took the light absolutely forever to get to your eyes

[Outro]
And as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment
Yeah, and as we gaze skyward, ain't it dark early?
It's the star treatment
It's the star treatment
The star treatment

Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band anorl (stop)
Back there by the baby grand, did Mr. Winter Wonderland say
"Come 'ere, kid, we really need to talk"?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

[Verse 2]
I fantasise, I call it quits, I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits, the chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks, thirsty for blood (stop)

[Bridge]
Oh, just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritised
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five
I suppose a singer must die

[Verse 3]
"Singsong 'Round the Money Tree"
This stunning documentary that no one else unfortunately saw
Such beautiful photography, it's worth it for the opening scene
I've been driving 'round listening to the score
Or maybe I just imagined it all
I've played to quiet rooms like this before
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band anorl (stop)
Back there by the baby grand, did Mr. Winter Wonderland say
"Come 'ere, kid, we really need to talk"?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

[Verse 2]
I fantasise, I call it quits, I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits, the chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks, thirsty for blood (stop)

[Bridge]
Oh, just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritised
And you cry some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five
I suppose a singer must die

[Verse 3]
"Singsong 'Round the Money Tree"
This stunning documentary that no one else unfortunately saw
Such beautiful photography, it's worth it for the opening scene
I've been driving 'round listening to the score
Or maybe I just imagined it all
I've played to quiet rooms like this before
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought

Jesus in the day spa, filling out the information form
Mama got her hair done, just popping out to sing a protest song
I've been on a bender back to that prophetic esplanade
Where I ponder all the questions but just manage to miss the mark

[Chorus]
Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

[Verse 2]
This magical thinking feels as if it really might catch on
Mama wants some answers
Do you remember where it all went wrong?
Technological advances really bloody get me in the mood
Pull me in close on a crisp eve, baby
Kiss me underneath the moon's side boob

[Chorus]
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

[Bridge]
And do you celebrate your dark side
Then wish you'd never left the house?
Have you ever spent a generation trying to figure that one out?

[Chorus]
Hoo
Good afternoon
Tranquility Base Hotel and Casino
Mark speaking
Please, tell me, how may I direct your call?

Last night when my psyche's
Subcommittee sang to me in its scary voice
You slowly dropped your eyelids
When true love takes a grip, it leaves you without a choice

[Chorus]
And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit, sometimes I fantasise about you too

[Verse 2]
The leader of the free world
Reminds you of a wrestler wearing tight golden trunks
He's got him sen a theme tune
They play it for him as he makes his way to the ring

[Chorus]
And in response to what you whispered in my ear
I must admit, sometimes I fantasise about you too

[Bridge]
In the daytime
Bendable figures with a fresh new pack of lies
Summat else to publicise
I'm sure you've heard about enough

[Chorus]
So in response to what you whispered in my ear
I'll be upfront, sometimes I fantasise about you too

Advertise in imaginative ways, start your free trial today
Come on in, the water's lovely
Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike, it is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night, dressed up in silver and white
With coloured Old Grey Whistle Test lights

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof, it was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of

[Verse 2]
Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express
The head of special effects in my mind’s eye
Hokey Cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget, doesn't time fly?
I'm in no position to give advice, I don't want to be nice
And you know that

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio is the place to go
And you will not recognise the old headquarters

[Bridge]
All the nights that never happened and the days that don't exist
At the Information-Action Ratio
The only time that we stop laughing is to breathe or steal a kiss
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
I can lift you up another semitone

[Chorus]
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Since the exodus, it’s all getting gentrified
The Information-Action Ratio (The Information-Action Ratio)
Is the place to go, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, now, it’s such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the moon (The Information-Action Ratio)
It got rave reviews, four stars out of five

[Outro]
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while (Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us, four stars out of five
(Take it easy for a little while)
Four stars out of five

[Verse 1]
You push the button and we'll do the rest
The exotic sound of data storage
Nothing like it, first thing in the morning
You push the button and we'll do the rest
Bastard Latin, that's the best thing for it
You push the button and we'll do the rest

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You and Lizzy in the summertime
Wrapping my tiny mind around a lullaby

[Chorus]
There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don't ever have to

[Verse 2]
Pattern language, in the mood for love
You push the button and we'll do the rest

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You and Genie wearing Stetson hats
Trying to gain access to my lily pad

[Chorus]
There are things that I just cannot explain to you
And those that I hope I don't ever have to

[Bridge]
The world's first ever monster truck front flip
I'm just a bad girl trying to be good
I've got a laser guiding my love that I cannot adjust

[Verse 3]
Forward-thinking model villages
More brain shrinking moving images
You push the button and we'll do the rest

Religious iconography giving you the creeps?
I feel rougher than a disco lizard tongue along your cheek
The rise of the machines
I must admit you gave me something momentarily
In which I could believe
But the hand of harsh reality's un-gloved
And it's on its way back here to scoop you up
But not on my watch

[Chorus]
I want to stay with you, my love
The way some science fiction does

[Verse 2]
Reflections in the silver screen of strange societies
Swamp monster with a hard-on for connectivity
The ascension of the C.R.E.A.M
Mass panic on a not too distant future colony
Quantitative easing
I want to make a simple point about peace and love
But in a sexy way where it's not obvious
Highlight dangers and send out hidden messages

[Chorus]
The way some science fiction does
The way some science fiction does

[Bridge]
Got the world on a wire
In my little mirror, mirror on the wall
In the pocket of my raincoat

[Outro]
So I tried to write a song to make you blush
But I've a feeling that the whole thing
May well just end up too clever for its own good
The way some science fiction does

One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
(She looks like fun)
(She looks like fun)
(She looks like fun)
(She looks like)

[Verse 1]
Smile like you've got a straw in something tropical
I've got the party plugged right into my skull
Wayne Manor, what a memorable NYE

[Chorus]
(She looks like fun) Good morning
(She looks like fun) Cheeseburger
(She looks like fun) Snowboarding
(She looks like)

[Verse 2]
Finally, I can share with you through cloudy skies
Every whimsical thought that enters my mind
There's no limit to the length of the dickheads we can be

[Chorus]
(She looks like fun) Bukowski
(She looks like fun) Dogsitting
(She looks like fun) Screwballing
(She looks like)

[Verse 3]
Finally, there's a place where you can wag your tongue
Baby, but why can't we all just get along?
Dance as if somebody's watching, 'cause they are

[Bridge]
No one's on the streets
We moved it all online as of March
I'm so full of shite
I need to spend less time stood around in bars
Waffling on to strangers all about martial arts
And how much I respect them

[Chorus]
(She looks like fun) Key changes
(She looks like fun) Re-thinking
(She looks like fun) New order
(She looks like fun)

I want an interesting synonym
To describe this thing
That you say we're all grandfathered in
I'll use the search engine
(We've got much to discuss)
Too much to discuss over a bucket of balls
I can recall the glow of your low beams

[Verse 2]
It's the big night in Tinsel City
Life became a spectator sport
I launch my fragrance called 'Integrity'
I sell the fact that I can't be bought
Have I told you all about the time that I got sucked into a hole
Through a handheld device?
I will flashback now and again, but I'm usually alright
Thankfully, the process has been simplified
Since the last time you tried

[Chorus 1]
I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul

[Verse 3]
You go in through the door
Vengeance Trilogy wallpaper walls
They have re-decorated it all
They've changed all the lights and the bar's down the side

[Chorus 2]
I've recognised the glow of your low beams numerous times
Through fairly opaque blinds in the sitting room
Vehicles will pass by, but I know when it's you
I'll be in a nose dive in my flying shoes
Right behind your closed eyes like a memory from your youth
I'll be by the Batphone if you need to get a hold
Making a selection, opening credits roll
Killer Pink Flamingos, computer controlled
Panoramic windows looking out across your soul

Still got pictures of friends on the wall
I suppose we aren't really friends anymore
Maybe I shouldn't ever have called that thing friendly at all
Get freaked out from a knock at the door
When I haven't been expecting one
And didn't that used to be part of the fun, once upon a time?
We'll be there at the back of the bar
In a booth like we usually were
Every time there was a rocket launch or some big event

[Verse 2]
What a death I died writing that song
Start to finish, with you looking on
It stays between us, Steinway, and his sons
'Cause it's the ultracheese
Perhaps it's time that you went for a walk
Dressed like a fictional character
From a place they called America in the golden age
Trust the politics to come along
When you were just tryna orbit the sun
When you were just about to be kind to someone
Because you had the chance

[Verse 3]
I've still got pictures of friends on the wall
I might look as if I'm deep in thought
But the truth is I'm probably not
If I ever was

[Outro]
Oh, the dawn won't stop weighing a tonne
I've done some things that I shouldn't have done
But I haven't stopped loving you once
