Anticipation has the habit to set you up
For disappointment in evening entertainment but
Tonight there'll be some love
Tonight there'll be a rawkus,
regardless of what's gone before
I want to see all of the things
that we've already seen
The lairy girls hung out
the window of the limousine
And of course its fancy dress
And they're all looking quite full on
In bunny ears and devil horns
I want to see all of the things
that we've already seen
I want to see you take the jackpot
out the fruit machine
And put it all back in
You've got to understand it
you can never beat the bandit
And she won't be surprised
and she won't be shocked
When she's pressed the star
after she's pressed unlock
And there's verse and chapter sat in her inbox
And all that it says is
that you've drank a lot
You should bear that in mind tonight
You can pour your heart out
but her reasoning will block
owt you send her after nine o clock
You can pour your heart out around 3 o clock
When the 2 for 1's undone the writers block
Sat at the side of the pool
at one of your houses
with wet white trousers on
And worlds collide as the evening
continues the dignity fucks off
Her brothers gone off to the strippers
 to make up for all the lost time
She could have been one of the bitches
but she's actually alright
Cigarette smoker,
I'm sorry but we're all unsure,
how much you've had but we think
that you ought to maybe not have anymore
A country home even
if we really tried wouldn't
cease to surprise us now
And bet your dad would like
to give us all a slap
when are your parents back d'you know?
I never came from no ghetto
but it wasn't nowhere near here
Well spoken girls and stilettos,
aren't something to fear
Cigarette smoker,
cigarette smoke doesn't hide
as well as you think and you'd think
that it ought to act as the perfect disguise
He's pining for her
In a people carrier
There might be buildings
and pretty things to see like that
But architecture won't do
Although it might say a lot about the city or town
I don't care
what they've got keep on turning them down
It don't say the funny things she does
Don't even try and cheer him up, because
It just won't happen
He's got the feeling again
This time on the aeroplane
There might be tellys
in the back of the seats in front
But Rodney and Del won't do
Although it might
take your mind off the aches and the pains
Laugh when he falls through the bar
But you're feeling the same
'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand
She won't be waiting for you when you land
It feels like she's just nowhere near
You could well be out on your ear
This thought comes closely followed by the fear
And the thought of it
Makes you feel a bit
I'll
Yesterday I saw a girl
Who looked like someone
you might knock about with
And almost shouted
And then reality kicked in within us
It seems as we become the winners
You lose a bit of summat
And half wonder if you won it at all

And don't say 'owt 'cause you've got no idea
And she's still nowhere near
And the thought comes closely
followed by the fear
And the thought of it
Makes you feel a bit
I'll

Despair in the departure lounge
It's one and they'll still be around at three
No signal and low battery
What's happened to me

Lady where has your love gone?
i was looking
but can't find it anywhere
They always offer
when there's loads of love around
but when you're short of some
it's nowhere to be found

I know your game,
you told him yesterday “no chance,
you'll get nothing from me”
but now she's there,
you're there and every
Body's there and he's i
turmoil as puzzled as can be,
just like me

Lets go down, low down
where i know i should not go
She thinks she's the one
but she's just one in 24
And just because everybody's doing it doe
that mean that i can too

Lady where has your love gone?
it was the antiseptic to the sore
To hold you by the hand
must he first be in demand?
how he longs for you to long for him once more

Her eyes went down and cut you up,
there's nothing like a dirty look from…
The one you want or the one you lost

And ache in your soul it's everybody's goal
to get what they can't have
That's why you're after her and
that's why she's after him
but saying it won't change a thing
Realising it won't change a thing.

We all want some one to shout for
Everyone wants somebody to adore
Your heroes aren't what they seem
When you've been where we've been

Have i done something to trigger…
The funny looks and the snigger?
Are they there at all…
Or is it just paranoia

Everybody's got there box
and are doing what they're told
You push my faith near being lost
but we'll stick to the guns
Don't care if its marketing suicide,
we won't crack or compromise,
your derisory devides will never unhinge us

There's a couple of hundred
Think they're Christopher Columbus
But the settlers had already settled here
long before you

Just because we're having a say so
And not lining up to be play doh
In five years time will it be;
who the fuck's arctic monkeys?

All the thoughts that i just said
Linger round and multiply in the head
Not that bad to start with,
I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed
