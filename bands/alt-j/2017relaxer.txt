Zero one one one zero zero one one
Crying zeros and I'm hearing one one ones
Cut my somersault sign my backflip
Pool summer summer pool pool summer
Kiss me
Hair the way the sun really wants it to be
Whiskey soda please your G&T's empty
Jeff's inflatables have sunk to the bottom
Pool summer summer pool pool summer
Kiss me
Cali let's dive dive down
To the pool's bottom where we belong
Cali you're sinking like a bleeding stone
All above crowd around so fucking loud
Mr Caspian's killer told me so La-la la-la la la
Heard it down on the radio La-la la-la la-la la
My pool summer summer pool summer vibes killed
In cold blood
Zero one one one zero zero one one
Crying zeros and I'm hearing one one ones
Lifeless back slaps the surface of the pool
Pool killer killer pool pool killer
Kiss me
Mr Caspian's killer told me so La-la la-la la la
Heard it down on the radio La-la la-la la-la la
Pool summer summer pool pool summer vibes killed
In cold blood
La-la la-la la la In cold blood in cold blood
La-la la-la la la
La-la la-la la la In cold blood

Caspian's killer told me so

I'm at the door at a quarter to four
Poppers popping baby might take some more
I'm fucking loose you're gorgeous I don't care
Come closer baby slap me like that snare
Moon Shaped Pool plays in the velvet cell
Green neon sign reading Welcome to Hell
Leather slings fall like oxygen masks
We're going down fuck my life in half
School of magic with brooms and wands
Pairs of people tugging like hungry dogs
For bone baby in the house of slithering
Floor full of happy wizards scissoring
I don't subscribe to your cultural norms
My church's doctrine has lost it's charm
Rise above the gloom of the jungle floor
Hit me like that snare more more more
I don't subscribe to your cultural norms
My church's doctrine has lost it's charm
Family matters I couldn't agree more
This is my family fisting me on the floor
Regret my safe word one to ten in Japanese
At the party carpet burning my knees
Na na na na na na na na na na na na
ichi ni san shi go roku nana hachi kyu jyuu
Ichi ni san go roku nana hachi kyu jyuu
Ichi ni san go roku nana hachi kyu jyuu
We are dangerous teenagers
We are dangerous teenagers
Fuck you I'll do what I want to do
Fuck you I'll do what I want to do
Fuck you I'll do what I want to do
Fuck you I'll do what I want to do
Extraordinarily pretty teeth
Beauty lingers out of reach
You're my DC oh Lee oh
Man Ray went cray cray over you
Capturing but never captured
You're my DC oh Lee oh

Oh my Adeline ooooh
Down in Tasmania
Where the devil's jaws are far too weak
To tear you away
Ooh I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
Oh my Adeline
I watch your morning swim again
Oh cold from the blue sky
Strokes from passing mopeds
My sweet Adeline
Ooh I wish you well my Adeline
I wish you well
I wish you well my Adeline
I wish you well
And the auld triangle went jingle jangle
On the Royal Canal
My Adeline was swimming
Sweet Adeline was singing
To the tune of Royal Canal
Swim
Swim on
Swim on
Swim on
Swim
Swim on
Swim on
Swim on
And the auld triangle went jingle jangle
On the Royal Canal
My Adeline was swimming
Sweet Adeline was singing
To the tune of Royal Canal
I wish her well
I wish her well
I wish her well
I wish her well
I wish her well
January came and took my heart away
February felt the same
March my hugs became hold ons
April I huffed like porridge on the boil
Morning May I'm downwind from your shampoo
Ichi ni san go roku nana hachi kyuu jyuu
June I learned to count to ten in Japanese
Dry July like wiping skin from my skull
Instead I visited family
They told me I'm special
Hmm
Augustus came and stabilised me with my father's pain
Relieving drug diazepam
Life floats away
October I swam back for my birthday
Firework display in a cafeteria of my old school
Happier in my cold black sleep in my cold deep bed
December you sang at my funeral
If it's depths to your rivers I've picked one for you
Oh greedy with S's but equalled by I's
If it's stones for your pockets I've collected a few
To hold you down
To hold you down
Mississippi come back to me
Oh Mississippi your cold black sleep
Oh Mississippi
Oh oh oh
Mississippi come back to me
Come Mississippi from your cold black sleep
Oh Mississippi
Hmm
Hmm
How green how green was my valley
To be told of such hills
To be held in such spots
To behold such warmth
Call to arms these harmonies
And in happy agony we sing
How green how green was my valley
How green how green was my valley
Oh your deeps and your shades
Where the wild roses pray
Such heat from pride
Glorious the voice of man
Like the nightingales we sing
How green how green was my valley
Clear softness in our hymn
Soft like coming rain
Soft like Bronwen
Victoria Victoria
Voices our queen might envy
How green how green was my valley
How green how green was my valley
There was a wayward lad
Stepped out one morning
The ground to be his bed
The sky his awning
Neon neon neon
A blue neon lamp in a midnight country field
Can't surround so you lean on lean on
So much your heart's become fond of this
Oh these three worn words
Oh that we whisper
Like the rubbing hands
Of tourists in Verona
I just want to love you in my own language
Well that smell of sex
Good like burning wood
The wayward lad laid claim
To two thirsty girls from Hornsea
Who left a note when morning came
Girls from the pool say Hi hi
The road erodes at five feet per year
Along England's east coastline
Was this your first time
Love is just a button we pressed
Last night by the campfire
Oh these three worn words
Oh that we whisper
Like the rubbing hands
Of tourists in Verona
I just want to love you in my own language
