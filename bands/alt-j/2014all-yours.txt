Hey
As she submarines
The rope loops round her feeble feet
Before the dawn
Breaks on her sorry grasp
In a blink and in one motion
Rope constricts
Rips her towards the ocean
She never finds her bearings
Sucking splash into her lungs
Though I cannot see
I can hear her smile as she sings
And though I cannot see
I can hear her smile as she sings
Nara
Soon
I'm gonna marry a man like no other
Light the fuse hallelujah hallelujah
Love love is the warmest colour
Petrol blues hallelujah hallelujah
Comes saut dans le vide my lover
In my youth the greatest tide washed up my prize
Follow let him go let him lead me be
Love is a pharaoh and in front of me
I thought let him be where he want to be
Love is a pharaoh and he's boning me
I've discovered a man like no other man
I've discovered a man like no other man
I've discovered a man like no other man
I've found a love to love like no other can
I've found a love to love like no other can
He's found me my Aslan
Hallelujah Bovay Alabama
Marry a man like no other
Hallelujah Bovay Alabama
Love is the warmest colour
Hallelujah Bovay Alabama
Unpin your butterflies Russia
Hallelujah Bovay Alabama
To be a deer in Nara
Hallelujah Bovay Alabama
Aaah
I want to share your mouthful
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I'm gonna bed into you like a cat beds into a beanbag
Turn you inside out and lick you like a crisp packet
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
You're the first and last of your kind
Hold me like an animal on top of her
I wanna be every lever you pull
And all showers that shower you
Gonna paw paw at you
Like a cat paws at my woolen jumper
Me I'm in bin
Ignore her worth and some trivia
Hey
Ooh devour me
Aaah
Lou Lou let the cover girls sing
Hey
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do
All hand claps
Human claps
Let me be the wallpaper that papers up your room
I want to be every button you press
And all mouths that surround you
Yes I'm gonna roll around you
Like a cat rolls around the chrysanthemums
I'm gonna kiss you like the sun browns you
Hey
Oh oh oh oh oh devour me
Oh oh oh oh oh oh devour me
Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh
If you really think that you can stomach me
Hey hey
Hey
Hey
Hey
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
Freckle
Hey shady baby I'm hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a battle eenie meenie miney moe
Hey flower you're the chosen one
Well your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun oh no
I tackle weeds just so the moon buggers nibble
A right hand grip on his Colt single-action army
Well your left hand's free
And your right's in a grip
With another left hand
Watch his right hand slip
Towards his gun oh no
N-E-O O-M-G gee whiz
Girl you're the one for me
Though your man's bigger than I am
All my days he disagrees oh no
Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
Hey shady baby I'm hot
Like the prodigal son
Pick a battle eenie meenie miney moe
Hey flower you're the chosen one
Well your left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
Well my left hand's free
Oh no
Choice Kingdom
Your choice kingdom
Their voice hear them
Our choice kingdom
Your choice kingdom
Our voice crowns men
Our choice kingdom
Rule Britannia
Bright ideas hide in caves
Rule Britannia
Break a stock into a slave
Rule Britannia
Leave us planked before the graves
Rule Britannia
Ruler of the waves
Sleeplessly embracing
Butterflies and needles
Line my seamed-up join
Encased in case I need it
In my stomach for my heart
Chain mail
Hunger of the pine
Hunger of the pine
Sleeplessly embracing
Yawn yearns into me
Plenty more tears in the sea
And so you finally use it
Bedding with me you see at night
Your heart wears knight armour
Hunger of the pine
I'm a female rebel
Sleeplessly
Embracing
You
Realization grew on me
As quickly as it takes your hand
To warm the cool side of the pillow
I'm there for you be there for me
I'll hum the song the soldiers sing
As they march outside our window
Hunger of the pine
Sleeplessly
Embracing
You
I'm a female rebel
Une immense espérance a traversé la terre*
Une immense espérance a traversé ma peur
A great hope has traversed the earth
A great hope has crossed my fear
Dry dunes cater for jumping boys
From the nape of her neck he made his descent
They watched men hurl from rock to sea
Like sternum to button lined lip pinches in between
Your foothills
Your warm
Iris swims quietly beside me
Oh the leaves and larger weeds sway and stretch themselves beneath
Blue dragonflies dart to and fro
I tie my life to your balloon and let it go
Your foothills
Your warm
No space
L-shaped
Tetris
Tile seeking
Somewhere
Oh somewhere
To fit in
Alien
Oh coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods

Civilian
Oh coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Jeremiah
Looking down
and you know where you're looking on
down
Do you know where you go
You're headed on the strings
For the
E-X-T-I-N-C-T
Jeremiah
Looking down but you know where you're looking
but you go
Do you know where you go
You're headed on the strings
For the

Oh coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Oh coming out of the woodwork
Chest bursts like John Hurt
Coming out of the woods
Heat shimmer
Hips quiver
Open smother
Lipped lover
Dead in the middle of the C-O-double-M-O-N
Little did I know then that the Mandela Boys
Soon become Mandela Men
Razor blades on a melted toothbrush
Slash slash Assassin de la police
Heat shimmer
Silky glistener
Open smother
Lipped lover
Dead in the middle of the C-O-double-M-O-N
Little did I know then that the Mandela Boys
Soon become Mandela Men
Silent knife unholy knife
I've fallen for the black outside my window
On the C-O-double-M-O-N
On the C-O-double-M-O-N
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart
A flood of blood to the heart Quelea quelea
If you're willing to wait for the love of your life
Please wait by the line
And you know dispersive prisms rainbow
But my native optimism isn't broken by the light
The idea of life without company fell suddenly
It crashed through the ceiling on me
And pinned me to the pine
And layer upon layer of hope and doubt
Will crush bones to oil in time
Are you a pusher or are you a puller
I pull the weight towards me
And I lack the zest of a lemon looking forward
Unless I have a woman pushing me
A canopy of red-billed quelea
Passed over the blue
A five hour flock not one dives down
To tell you the truth
As night falls a quelea crawls
And whispers on his last wings
So abundant are we left alone I shall be
But a waited phone never rings
Are you a pusher or are you a puller
I pull the weight towards me
And I lack the zest of a lemon looking forward
Unless I have a woman pushing me
Are you a pusher or are you a puller
We could hold hands for fifteen minutes in the sauna
We could hold hands for a pool length under water
I can push and pull
Her
If you're willing to wait for the love of your life
Please wait by the line
Bovay Alabama
I'll bury my hands deep
Into the mane of my lover
Bovay Alabama
In the arms of the warmest colour
When I wake up in the morning light
Sunlight hurts my eyes
Something without warning love
Plays heavy on my mind
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Oh just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
On the night line
For the night line
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way
Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
On the night line
For the night line
