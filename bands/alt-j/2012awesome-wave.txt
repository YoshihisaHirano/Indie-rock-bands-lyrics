Shit them all festival laugh at the beautiful
It's just a nod to the canon
Simple man Stan can't stand up on the beautiful
It's just a nod to the canon
Stickle brick tickle quick laugh at the beautiful
It's just a nod to the canon
Hustle over hot muscle shower twitch off the beautiful
It's just a nod to the canon now
She she she she only ever-ver-ver-ver walks to to count count her steps
Eighteen-teen strides and she stops to abide
By the law that she herself has set
That eighteen steps is one complete set
And before the next nine right and nine left
She looks up up at the blue
And whispers to all of the above
Don't let me drown don't breathe alone
No kicks no pangs no broken bones
Never let me sink always feel at home
No sticks no shanks and no stones
Never leave it too late always enjoy the taste
Of the great great great grey world of hearts
As all dogs everywhere bark bark bark bark
It's worth knowing
Like all good fruit the balance of life is in the ripe and ruin
Bite chunks out of me
You're a shark and I'm swimming
My heart still thumps as I bleed
And all your friends come sniffing
Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe back to back let's go my love; it's very late
'Til morning comes let's tessellate
Go alone my flower
And keep my whole lovely you
Wild green stones alone my lover
And keep us on my heart
Three guns and one goes off
One's empty one's not quick enough
One burn one red one grin
Search the graves while the camera spins
Chunks of you will sink down to seals
Blubber rich in mourning they'll nosh you up
Yes they'll nosh the love away but it's fair to say
You will still haunt me
Triangles are my favorite shape
Three points where two lines meet
Toe to toe back to back let's go my love; it's very late
'Til morning comes let's tessellate
She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Cetirizine your fever's gripped me again
Never kisses—all you ever send are full stops la la la
Do you know where the wild things go
They go along to take your honey la la la
Break down now weep
Build up breakfast now let's eat
My love my love love love la la la
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
Do you know where the wild things go
They go along to take your honey la la la
Break down now sleep
Build up breakfast now let's eat
My love my love love love
She bruises coughs she splutters pistol shots
Hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
She's morphine queen of my vaccine
My love my love love love la la la
Muscle to muscle and toe to toe
The fear has gripped me but here I go
My heart sinks as I jump up
Your hand grips hand as my eyes shut
She may contain the urge to run away
But hold her down with soggy clothes and breezeblocks
Germolene disinfect the scene
My love my love love love
But please don't go I love you so my lovely
Please don't go please don't go
I love you so I love you so
Please don't go please don't go
I love you so I love you so
Please break my heart hey
Please don't go please don't go
I love you so I love you so
Please don't go please don't go
I love you so I love you so
Please break my heart
Please don't go I'll eat you whole
I love you so I love you so I love you so
Please don't go I'll eat you whole
I love you so I love you so I love you so I love you so
Please don't go I'll eat you whole
I love you so I love you so I love you so
Please don't go I'll eat you whole
I love you so I love you so I love you so
Please don't go I'll eat you whole
I love you so I love you so I love you so
Please don't go I'll eat you whole
I love you so I love you so I love you so
Please don't go I'll eat you whole
I love you so I love you so I love you so
Something good oh something good oh something good
Oh something good tonight will make me forget about you for now
Get high hit the floor before you go
Matador estocada you're my blood sport
But something good oh something good oh something good
Oh something good tonight will make me forget about you for now
Forty-eight thousand seats bleats
And roars for my memories of you
Now that I'm fully clean
The matador is no more and is dragged from view
Get high hit the floor before you go
Matador estocada you're my blood sport
Forty-eight thousand seats bleats
And roars for my memories of you
Now that I am clean
The matador is no more and is dragged from view
But something good oh something good oh something good
Oh something good tonight will make me forget about you for now
Now dissolve me two tabs on your tongue
A herd of shepherds to herd the sheep sleep now my only one
Broken sweethearts who sleep apart
Both still pine for the other's side spine spoon as sleep starts
And pulse to pulse now shush
She makes the sound the sound the sea makes to calm me down
I am see-through soap sliver you're so thin
As I begin rubbing lathers up your state worsens on my skin
And gold fatless finger to lip one two three four hush
And pulse to pulse now shush
She makes the sound the sound the sea makes to calm me down
She makes the sound the sound the sea makes I'm tired now
Oooohhhh Oooooooooohhhhh Oooooooohhhhhhhh Oohhh Oooooooooohhhhhhhhhhh
She makes the sound the sea makes knee-deep in the North Sea
This is from this is from
This is from Matilda
Just like Johnny Flynn said
The breath I've taken and the one I must to go on
Put the grenade pin in your hand so you understand who's boss
My defeat sleeps top to toe with her success
Oh this is from this is from this is from Matilda
And she needs you this is from Matilda
And she needs you this is from Matilda
Just like Johnny Flynn said
The breath I've taken and the one I must to go on
Put the grenade pin in your hand so you understand who's boss
My defeat sleeps top to toe with her success
Oh this is from this is from this is from Matilda
And she needs you this is from Matilda
And she needs you this is from Matilda
And she needs you this is from Matilda
Elle a﻿ besoin de toi
Cela vient de Matilda
And she needs you this is from Matilda
And she needs you this is from Matilda
And she needs you this is from Matilda
And she needs you this is from Matilda
This is from Matilda
This is from Matilda
Matilda Matilda Matilda
We can't lose touch but we can let go blue and white gun made from Lego
All the vowels vow to hold your name keep your estate clean of me
I've pillowed you so many times this week
Close eyes open close again forget and fall asleep
The dark seeks dark
The dark seeks dark
Darker
Darker
The nights of all my youth pressed into one glass of water
Scattered truths bewildered beast boohoos we have our weight: ten thousand ladybirds
All the vowels vow to guard your name keep your estate clean happy
Some things lie too deep for tears to well
Close eyes open close again feel as my body spells
Dark seeks dark
Dark seeks dark
Darker
Darker
The shadow burns across like embers tide paper
Darker darker darker darker
Tralala trala tra-a-la la
In your snatch fits pleasure broom-shaped pleasure
Deep greedy and
Googling every corner
La trala tra-a-la lalalala lalala
Dead in the middle of the C-O-double M-O-N
Little did I know then
That the Mandela Boys soon become Mandela Men
Tall woman pull the pylons down
And wrap them around the necks
Of all the feckless men that queue to be the next
Steepled fingers ring lalalala lalalala leaders
Queue queue jumpers rock fist paper scissors lalala lalala lingered fluffers
Require
In your hoof lies the heartland
Where we tent for our treasure pleasure leisure les yeux
It's all in your eyes
In your snatch fits pleasure broom-shaped pleasure
Aaaah
Deep greedy and Googling every corner
Tralala trala tra-a-la lalalala lalala
Ooooooh
Blended by the lights
Good morning flood of blood
Good morning everyone
C-O-double M-O-N a wave an awesome wave
That rushes skin and widens in blooded veins
Breathe in exhale I've poked a nerve
He'll slap me like a whale
Slaps the C-O-double M-O-N
Tide out tide in a flood of blood
To the heart and the fear slipstreams
Breathe in exhale I've poked a nerve
He'll slap me like a whale
Slaps the C-O-double M-O-N
Flood of blood to the heart
Indochina Capa jumps Jeep two feet creep up the road
To photo to record meat lumps and war
They advance as does his chance very yellow white flash
A violent wrench grips mass rips light tears limbs like rags
Burst so high finally Capa lands
Mine is a watery pit
Painless with immense distance
From medic from colleague friend enemy foe
Him five yards from his leg from you Taro
Do not spray into eyes I have sprayed you into my eyes
3:10 PM Capa pends death quivers last rattles last chokes
All colors and cares glaze to gray shriveled and stricken to dots
The left hand grasps what the body grasps not
Le photographe est mort
Three point one four one five alive no longer my amour
Faded for home May of '54
Doors open like arms my love
Painless with a great closeness
To Capa to Capa Capa dark after nothing re-united with his leg and with you Taro
Taro
Do not spray into eyes I have sprayed you into my eyes
Hey Taro
Your sting red full stops my skin dotted scratch scratch now I'm bleeding
Legions upon legions of craftsmen handmade my feelings
There's bears in the wood and they're out to get me
And I'm safe from harm if I stay in this chalet
And hold me tight and I'll sink in
I'm absorbed in your thinking
But you don't know
You-ooooo
But you don't know
You-ooooo
Your sting red full stops my skin dotted scratch scratch now I'm bleeding
Legions upon legions of craftsmen handmade my feelings
For you-oooo
For you-oooo
