Look at this poor boy
All dressed up in white
Now how can he smile
With a face of all eyes
He wanders the night
Through sneers and words snide
Spinning round and round
His precious mind
Like dizzy neon lights
Can anybody find out
Any other way
It's choking up his throat now
And dripping out his mouth
Like liquified and dying sparks
Like burning butterflies
These creatures are vampires
They're killing by the night
They're falling from the dead trees
To silhouette your life
He sees his white face
Brains lit grey and cold
Trees grow in their throats
And crystals ignored
His cellophane mask
Has filled up with smoke
Look through the holes in his eyes
And see his red righteous soul
Can anybody find out
Any other way
It's choking up his throat now
And dripping out his mouth
These creatures are vampires
They're killing by the night
They're hanging from the dead trees
Like burning butterflies
This old goat with beard of grey
He turns his leather gripped cane
Those times you clapped and called for quiet
They've come to hold you ain't that nice
He packs a fat oom paul to
Jib and make home-baked perfume
Sips froth from soft warm joe
Snug eiderdown bedclothes
You know you know the way that I
Come on you hermit
You never fight back
Why don't you play with bows and arrows
Why don't you dance like
You're sick in your mind
Why don't you set your wings on fire
You slick back that wiry mane
A neat tucked slice
Deep trees sleep on the dank lawn
And scratch the slate
You finger down that waxen line
Between your breasts
A squeaky pain upon each breath
The plumbers left
You know the way that I feel
Come on you hermit
You never fight back
Why don't you play with bows and arrows
Why don't you dance like
You're sick in your mind
Why don't you set your wings on fire
Come on you hermit
Why don't you play nice
Why don't you toy with sex and violence
Why don't you stare back
Into my huge eye
Why don't you set my wings on fire
One young fawn in a maze
Eager-eyed and the milky haze
Scampers round heavy feet
Spinny legs and knobbly knees
Twitching tail and tongue-in-cheek
She munches fruit from harlot trees
Looking smug and fresh and pleased
She wanders so sloppily and eats
She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and she's icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It makes her well up it makes her well up
She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and she's icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It makes her well up it makes her well up
She feels a lick down her nape
It looks up with a fair glass face
The peeling palms of dirty hands
Jointed thumbs with drumstick ends
Yellow nails from pinching fags
A slimy creature lacking clad
He pulls his fingers from her mind
And lets her see just like she was blind!
She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and she's icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It makes her well up it makes her well up
She puts her hands up to the sky
She puts her hands up and she's icing her lie
She puts her hands up to the sky
It make her well up it makes her well up
