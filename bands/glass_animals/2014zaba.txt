Here's to the one with the smoking stare
Running through my head with a bolo knife
Chopping up the threads made up from looms
Of love and blood and hate and some empty tunes
Eyes killer cold and black and bare
Freaky little tooth hanging solo
Sucking at the walls like a rolo now
Making a cocoon where my brain fits
I wanna go back I wanna go back
I wanna go back with a club and attack
I wanna take to my guns and break you
I gotta make my little foe take his own
I wanna go back I wanna go back
I wanna go back with a club and attack
I wanna take to my guns and break you
I gotta make my little foe take his own
I'm overgrown with a yellow mold
Just fizzing drones in a hollow dome
My funny nose dripping little groans
I'm so so cold in the marrow of my bones
I look at you as you take a snooze
Your skinny lips dripping rabid goo
I lift your chin and I grin at you
As you come to man
I'm running round your head with a bolo knife
I'm gonna go back I'm gonna go back
I'm gonna go back to a face no more mask
I was in full bloom until I met you
I'm gonna shake my fetters I'm breaking loose
I'm gonna go back I'm gonna go back
I'm gonna go back to a face no more mask
I was in full bloom until I met you
I'm gonna shake my fetters I'm breaking loose
I'm gonna go back I'm gonna go back
I'm gonna go back to a face no more mask
I was in full bloom until I met you
I'm gonna shake my fetters I'm breaking loose
What'll it be now mister mole
Whispers sloth in curls of smoke
Take a back seat or play pharaoh
Dance with me and shake your bones
Slow down
It's a science
He's been waiting to
Bring you down
Snake eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you child
Leopards laze each on plush pillows
Slender capes of red and chrome
Paperback dreams in their deep doze
Twitch their toes to black mambo
Slow down
It's a science
He's been waiting to
Bring you down
Snake eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you child
Wanna play cheat now says the sloth
A domino flush to his nose
Tickle that cheek and take your throne
Pump your veins with gushing gold
Slow down
It's a science
He's been waiting to
Bring you down
Snake eyed
With a sly smile
He can hold you
And shake you child
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We can hold you
We float before the sea at dusk
In heavy mist in glitter dust
I smile before I want to
I smile because you want to
We sip the wind through lips of lust
And out it comes warm wisps of love
I smile because I want to
I smile because you want to
Put the flowers in your hair
Wrap your tendrils round my chest
I smile because I want to
I am your boy
Shake my little soul for you now toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I'm a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise
Down by the shore a funny foal
Who bit my wings and ate them whole
You left before I come to
You left before I come to
We took to hills into the trees
I hit my head and bit the leaves
You left before I come to
You left before I
Shake my little soul for you now toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I'm a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise
Shanks of slate fall to the beach
Wrapped in life in ultra greens
Pools teem with tiny feet
And whorls of tired anemones
You left before I got to
You left before I got to
You left before I
You left before I
Shook the flowers from your hair
Run to me and kiss my hands
I'm dead before I
I'm dead before I
Alright come close
Let me show you everything I know
A jungle slang
Spinning round my head and I stare
While my naked fool
Fresh out of an icky gooey womb
A woozy youth
Dopes up on her silky smooth perfume
Right my little pooh bear wanna take a chance
Wanna sip the smooth air kick it in the sand
I'll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes
My my simple sir this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can't take this place no I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space
Truth be told
I've been there I've done this all before
I take your gloom
I curl it up and puff it into plumes
Right my little pooh bear wanna take a chance
Wanna sip the smooth air kick it in the sand
I'll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes
My my simple sir this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can't take this place no I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space
Hold my hand and float back to the summer time
Tangled in the willows now our tongues are tied
How can I believe you how can I be nice
Tripping round tree stumps in your summer smile
Right my little pooh bear wanna take a chance
Wanna sip the smooth air kick it in the sand
I'll say I told you so but you just gonna cry
You just wanna know those peanut butter vibes
My my simple sir this ain't gonna work
Mind my wicked words and tipsy topsy slurs
I can't take this place no I can't take this place
I just wanna go where I can get some space
Hi my little naked man
I saw you there looking sad
Face so lost petrified
Timid twitch in your wide eyes
My oh my such strange supplies
Many spoons all in a pile
Did you bend 'em with your mind
Precious precious right right right
Honey honey don't you cry
It's a ruse
All these creatures are a lie
Funny bunny it's alright
I clap my hands
And they're gone into the night
Wiggle toes on wicker braids
Hanging with their nails so frayed
Mini fruits all bone dry
And a cape black tie-dyed
I bet I can make you smile
In the pools of moonlight
Watch this little trick of mine
Say with me this tiny rhyme
Honey honey don't you cry
It's a ruse
All these creatures are a lie
Funny bunny it's alright
I clap my hands
And they're gone into the night
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Gone inside of the wild zabajaba
All the mad and the sad gonna have at ya
Sour plants hungry fangs jabazaba
Tangled mass in the vast zabajaba
Your baby's fallen
You know I'm talking now
You know I'm dancing
You know I'm racing round
No no you're so juiced
You said you'd kick the booze
You know I'll get bruised
You know I'm just a boy
Come back baby don't you cry
Don't you drain those big blue eyes
I've been crawling
Come back baby don't you cry
Just you say the reason why
I can calm you
You say I'm bawling
I say I'm begging while
You take my photo
I fake my breaking smile
I'm fucking loco
I can't get through to you
You turn your nose you
Spark up and I can go
Come back baby don't you cry
Don't you drain those big blue eyes
I've been crawling
Come back baby don't you cry
Just you say the reason why
I can calm you
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Take my hand
Put your hand down boy
Welcome to my zoo
Put your head inside
My big black wild while
I can still help you
See the snake baboon
Funky chic and smooth
Honey can you spy
The divine ape-swine
Cause he can see you
I'm a man I'm a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
I'm a man don't spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I'm crooked but upright
And all I ever want
Is just a little love
I said in purrs under the palms
And all I ever want is breaking me apart
I said to the thing that I once was
I'm a man I'm a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
I'm a man don't spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I'm crooked but upright
To the left now boy
Underneath the moon
By the thick tan sand
And the tall thin grass
One more thing for you
See the distant flume
In the sleepy dunes
Makes my nerves clench close
And my bones go cold
When I see that room
And all I ever want
Is just a little love
I said in purrs under the palms
And all I ever want is breaking me apart
I'm a man I'm a twisted fool
My hands are twisted too
Five fingers to black hooves
I'm a man don't spin me a lie
Got toes and I can smile
I'm crooked but upright
Twee vole go dig your hole
Squish squirmies in your nose
Tree hairs in your eyes
You smile so super quiet
Free air you sip on
A cave edge a black bowl
Breathe in deep and slow
As your own splash echoes
Don't go please don't go please don't go please don't go please
You can't run so you must hide
You won't make it back this time
I sold your rope for a bucket
Of lemon peel now suck it
So my friend our time is done
You and I could've had so much
With ropes for the bucket
Of luscious black gold nuggets yeea
Oh vole where did you go
Dim lanterns held by groans
Of beasties sad and tired
Lost in the muck and
It's all dank and gross
Slugs on shrooms bubble smoke
Through pipes and mondo rolls
Their fuzzy warbles drone
Babe babe babe please don't go
You can't run so you must hide
You won't make it back this time
I sold your rope for a bucket
Of lemon peel now suck it
So my friend our time is done
You and I could've had so much
With ropes for the bucket
Of luscious black gold nuggets yeea
You can't run so you must hide
You won't make it back this time
I sold your rope for a bucket
Of lemon peel now suck it
So my friend our time is done
You and I could've had so much
With ropes for the bucket
Of luscious black gold nuggets yeea
Don't go
This old goat with beard of grey
He turns his leather gripped cane
Those times you clapped and called for quiet
They've come to hold you ain't that nice
He packs a fat oom paul to
Jib and make home-baked perfume
Sips froth from soft warm joe
Snug eiderdown bedclothes
You know you know the way that I
Come on you hermit
You never fight back
Why don't you play with bows and arrows
Why don't you dance like
You're sick in your mind
Why don't you set your wings on fire
You slick back that wiry mane
A neat tucked slice
Deep trees sleep on the dank lawn
And scratch the slate
You finger down that waxen line
Between your breasts
A squeaky pain upon each breath
The plumbers left
You know the way that I feel
Come on you hermit
You never fight back
Why don't you play with bows and arrows
Why don't you dance like
You're sick in your mind
Why don't you set your wings on fire
Come on you hermit
Why don't you play nice
Why don't you toy with sex and violence
Why don't you stare back
Into my huge eye
Why don't you set my wings on fire
