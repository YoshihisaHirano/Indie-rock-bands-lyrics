Pullin' down backstreets deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin' down backstreets deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
That first friend you had that worst thing you said
That perfect moment that last tear you shed
All you've done in bed all on Memorex
All 'round-'round your head all 'round-'round your head
Pullin' down backstreets deep in your head
Slippin through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin' down backstreets deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
You've had too much of the digital love
You want everything live you want things you can touch
Make it feel like a movie you saw in your youth
Make it feel like that song that just unopened you
You were ten years old holdin' hands in the classroom
He had a gun on the first day of high school
You want something bizarre old conceptual cars
You want girls dressed in drag you want boys with guitars
Pullin' down backstreets deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
Pullin' down backstreets deep in your head
Slippin' through dreamland like a tourist
You see Kodachrome you see pink and gold
You see Mulholland glow you see in airplane mode
All 'round-'round your head all 'round-'round your head
All 'round-'round your head all 'round-'round your head
You float in the pool where the soundtrack is canned
You go ask your questions like What makes a man
Oh it's 2020 so it's time to change that
So you go make an album and call it Dreamland
As cold as an old ice cream sandwich as focused as Mr Miyagi
You poke at your phone posting aerial photos of you and your smoothie
I can't keep on making you happy 'cause you got issues with your daddy
I miss ramen noodles and laughing at you and your gran in home movies
But I wish I could show you more of yourself
I wish I could make you somebody else
But I left it way too late
Are you stuck in your own ways
I'm begging
Hands knees please tangerine come on back to me
You got what I need tangerine do this for me
Hands knees please tangerine sugar honey sweet
Got what I need tangerine
You let the devil in and all you talk is money money money money money
It's so funny how it changes how you feel
How you see how you need how you sleep
All your freedom caffeine how you're looking at me
But I love it when the light sits on you just right
Tiny tangerine speckles painted in your eyes
Hands knees please tangerine come on back to me
You got what I need tangerine do this for me
Hands knees please tangerine sugar honey sweet
Got what I need tangerine
Oh my God
Drop the beat
You've been dreamlessly sleepin' for years
Super clear since the late 1990s
You only look at me properly now
When you're drunk watching movies
Where are you What happened I want what we had
Where you gone Where you hidin'
It's 2:23 you got Friends on repeat on repeat on repeat on repeat on repeat on re—
I wish I could show you more of yourself
I wish I could make you somebody else
But I left it way too late
Are you stuck in your own ways I'm begging
Hands knees please tangerine come on back to me
Got what I need tangerine do this for me
Hands knees please tangerine sugar honey sweet
Got what I need tangerine
Hands knees please tangerine come on back to me
Got what I need tangerine do this for me
Hands knees please tanger—
Tangerine
I'm beggin' Hands knees please tangerine come on back to me
You got what I need tangerine do this for me
Hands knees please tangerine sugar honey sweet
Got what I need tangerine Woah
Long black tulips born in your blue tints
Lemongrass eyelids smoke in your slick lips
Chocolate chapstick backbeat strat flips
Swimming pool spaceships light through the wave tips
Hot sugar in the afternoon
I wish that we could be real too
Hot sugar in the afternoon
I wish that we could be real too
So cool but we don't talk
Hotels and alcohol
Pool paintings on the wall
Hot rubber on the tar
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like
Bath time cool whip
Watermelon juice kiss
Esprit gold rims
Skin so sun-licked
Santal freshness
Hologram glasses
Put it on plastic
You never been desperate
Hot sugar in the afternoon
I wish that we could be real too
Hot sugar in the afternoon
I wish that we could be real too
So cool but we don't talk
Hotels and alcohol
Pool paintings on the wall
Hot rubber on the tar
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you
Just wanna be like you
Just wanna be like you
Just wanna be like you
So cool but we don't talk
Hotels and alcohol
Pool paintings on the wall
Hot rubber on the tar
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you
I don't wanna be around you
Just wanna be like you
So cool

I said to you Why did you do it
Touch the glass I'll feel ya through it
Against the wall with the bracelets on
You look bizarre in the apricot
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit now I go
My way and you go yours
Gotta be all that coco ayy
Playin' too much of that GTA
Playin' too much of that Dr Dre
Doom Quake where'd you get the gun from eh
Really think that metal gonna make you safe
Playing peek-a-boo with the devil these days
Black cap back with a trench coat ayy
Living in the valley cuttin' porno tapes
Living in the valley cuttin' porno
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit now I go
My way and you go yours
Were you bored of gender norms
Of being alone no mama home
A bad divorce or sad we can't
Afford the clothes our heroes own
Remember when you stole
Mom's old Geo Metro
You wore her old bathrobe
Too small to see the road
We were just two Texas toddlers
Pokémon and bottle rockets
Dunkaroos and Real Monsters
Capri Sun straw in the bottom
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit now I go
My way and you go yours
Heard you were lookin' up the cookbook names
Cut into the back of your bedroom door frame
Supervillain with a manifesto dang
Gotta say I'm pretty glad they caught you man
Get back to the kickball days
Scared to hold hands at school disco days
007 Nintendo James
Bond Hot Pockets in the microwave
You think that you're Space Ghost
You're wanted coast to coast
Fuck that shit now I go
My way and you go yours
Living in the valley cuttin' porno
Driftin'
Huh huh huh Tokyo driftin'
Two things 'bout the geez you better listen up
Chrome spokes with the spinners on his tire hubs
Suck smoke in his '40 windows up
He rolls like he really doesn't give a-
Drug lust and two packets in your pocket
Disco dust hits your nose like a rocket
Doo-doo-doo doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo doo doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Scoot-scoot boy race out to the super-club
Let it rip like you drank all of the tequila
Get loose street fighter tear it up
Fresh footwear drippin' out of you onto the rug
Ooh now you're lettin' go
Heart beatin' faster feet pushin' on the floor
Ain't nothin' better
Ooh now you're lettin' go
Heart beatin' faster feet pushin' on the floor

Niggas wanna talk about a G
But I spent a G on the twelve teeth in my mouth Huh huh huh
Diamonds aquatic it feel like a trout on my wrist Wrist
Or a spout on my wrist with a spider up in it In it
Everything gotta be eighty and you keep the twenty percentage
You know that I get it I'm on it I'm in it
If you try to take it the clip get extended

Melon and the coconut are sittin' on the floor
Coco said to Melly I can't do this anymore
Everything we're doin' just feels fuckin' cold
Everything we're shootin' that's just fake B-roll
B-sides killing time filler that's all
How did things happen when we were so close
How did this all go so Pete Tong
When it all started I thought we would grow old
Living in the city with a baby and a dog
Doing school runs in a four by four
I make pancakes and waffles
I could be a stay at home GI Joe
Melly said to Coco You can't do this anymore
One day you'll see you're fuckin' wrong
Sometimes B-sides are the best songs
Sometimes killing time's very fruitful
I know I can't make you younger
I can't stop life movin' onwards
I can't hide you from life's horrors
I'm not makin' you like your father
Too much quinoa and online shopping
Off-White Air Force Ones in boxes
You're a fucking coconut can't even put 'em on
Even if you could you couldn't even pull 'em off
Mmm I shut my eyes
You call but I just cut the line
I know your style
I know that you want one more night
And I'm backsliding
Into this just one more time
Too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin' through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh so much déjà vu
And now
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more
'Cause I can feel your love
Mmm that purple touch
Everyone who sees you falls in love
You eat us up
You live like you're on camera
You slide on top
A moon to all the juice in us
Too far from over you
Beams from your M2
Are blowin' through my room
And now you lay down in my shoes
You dyed your hair blue
Oh so much déjà vu
And now
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more
'Cause I can feel your love
Woo
Maybe in time
When we're both better at life
Daylight can open my eyes
And you'll still be by my side
But meanwhile
I've got my contact high
You've got your powdered lies
We've got these summertime nights
Night by night I let you eat me alive
I want you to eat me alive
I want you to eat me alive
Woo
Ayy ayy ayy ayy
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
I can feel your love
Your temporary touch
It's a hit and run
You go back there when you're done
Don't you want some more
'Cause I can feel your love
I can feel your love
I can feel your love
I can feel your love
I can feel your love
I can feel your love
Drip drop
Gimme what you got
Your talk is incredible
So so so unusual
You taste like surfing videos
I'm going to read your mind
Big dicks and big ol' titties on the sly
Say I got Aries eyes
Fuck no I'm a bonafide Aquemini
Ooh who are you hiding
White Russians and dirty diamonds
You fake your shyness
I just wish that I could see through you
Cheap booze Pepsi blue
You got bottles in from 2002
Hot glue vape juice
Hit undo how the hell are you so cool
Drip drop
Gimme what you got
Your talk is incredible
So so so unusual
You taste like surfing videos
It's chemical warfare
Red lips and television eyewear
Raspberry soda hair
In the pool in a blow-up gummy bear
Fake youth Scooby-Doo
Push Pops on the corner of the roof
Froot Loops superfood
Chat shit but where's the real you
Never seen The Price Is Right
I'm a liar I've been on that shit since '99
You make me like a clown
Clap clap you're a clever-clever cookie now
Waterfalls coming out your mouth
What the hell are we doing now
Waterfalls tearing you apart
What the hell are we doing now
Ooh
I break it by God your face
Awakened two eyes ballooning
Open sesame
Super silence in the quiet eye inside the storm
Water from your broken iris fell toward the floor
Everything waiting shakin' as it drops
I tried for you and I for too hard for too long
Gave it all and everything for more time but I lost
Ooh we're breakin' down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
Heartbreak was never so loud
Ooh
Ooh I'm breakin' down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
Heartbreak was never so loud
Two hearts foldin'
Pulling everything
Ooh I'm breakin' down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
Heartbreak was never so loud
Ooh I'm breakin' down
Whispers would deafen me now
You don't make a sound
It's all so incredibly loud
It's all so incredibly loud
I see the bruise I see the truth
I see what he been doin' to you
Blood on the shoes what's his excuse
He says he's doing some new kung fu
You always use his bullshit excuse
But I see what he been doin' to you
Why'd you put up with that shit
Why'd you go back for that kiss
Maybe it tastes like him when you've got tears on your lips
Why'd you put up with that shit
Why don't we pack and leave this
Why do you smile when he cries
Why do you cry when he wins
Fight for me
We can leave I'm beggin' please
On my-on my knees go to Hawaii
Fight for me say We can leave I'm beggin' please
On my-on my knees
Hawa-Hawaii
He got balloons new flowers too
Last one's dyin' in your bedroom
He squeezin' you blame-blamin' you
Mama just usin' her red perfume
Domestic bliss
I know how bad you wanted it
Why'd you put up with that shit
Why'd you go back for that kiss
Maybe it tastes like him when you've got tears on your lips
Why'd you put up with that shit
Why don't we pack and leave this
Why do you smile when he cries
Why do you cry when he wins
Fight for me
We can leave I'm beggin' please
On my-on my knees go to Hawaii
Fight for me say We can leave I'm beggin' please
On my-on my knees
Hawa-Hawaii
My God I'll be right in the trickle of lightnin'
I knew before I heard I felt it in my skin
My God I'll be right in the trickle of lightnin'
I knew before I heard I felt it in my skin
Fight for me
We can leave I'm beggin' please
On my-on my knees go to Hawaii
Fight for me say We can leave I'm beggin' please
On my-on my knees
Hawa-Hawaii
Last night all I think about is you
Don't stop baby you can walk through
Don't want baby think about you
You know that I'm never gonna lose
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat heat waves I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat heat waves I'm swimmin' in a—
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Usually I put somethin' on TV
So we never think about you and me
But today I see our reflections clearly
In Hollywood layin' on the screen
You just need a better life than this
You need somethin' I can never give
Fake water all across the road
It's gone now the night has come but
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
You can't fight it you can't breathe
You say somethin' so lovin' but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new
I don't wanna be alone
You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry
One more and then I'll say goodbye
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
I just wonder what you're dreamin' of
When you sleep and smile so comfortable
I just wish that I could give you that
That look that's perfectly un-sad
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Sometimes all I think about is you
Late nights in the middle of June
Heat waves been fakin' me out
Can't make you happier now
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat heat waves I'm swimmin' in a mirror
Road shimmer wigglin' the vision
Heat heat waves I'm swimmin' in a mirror
9:09
You gonna call it or am I
One more time
This puppy love is out of line
One more slide
And then we're back to real life
Ooh and I'm falling now but it's so wrong
You talk like a man and taste like the sun
Ooh and you lift your eyes up from the dust
I knew just then I knew it was done
I guess I want you more than I thought I did
Now that I know that part of you's at home with him
I guess I want you more than I thought I did
Now that I know that part of you's not part of this
Soft blue skies
Helium balloons float up away
Broad daylight
But we're sunflowers in the rain
My mama said they used to be white pyramids
They float above the sand they're slowly sinking in
Are our foundations destined to keep crumbling
Just 'cause we started this with zero innocence
I just can't build on something that begins like this
It's a blood diamond flawless but for that one thing
You just want backstreets you don't want me
You just gonna hate it all the way
You just want backstreets you don't want me
You just gonna hate it all the way
Hello who is this Hello
Are you watching TV
Say Bye-bye
Bye-bye
