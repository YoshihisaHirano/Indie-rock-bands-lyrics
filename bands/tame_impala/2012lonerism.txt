Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it

Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I know that I can't let them bring me down
And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
And I know that I gotta be above it now
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it

And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I gotta bide my time as a face in the crowd
And I know that I gotta be above it now
And I cannot let them all just bring me down
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it
This time I'm just gonna take it all I'm never gonna shake it up
I'll just close my eyes and make so that all the things don't affect me now
I know that I gotta be above it now
And I cannot let them all just bring me down
This time I'm just gonna take or I'm never gonna shake it
I'll just close my eyes and make so that all the things don't affect me now
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it gotta be above it
Gotta be above it
Soothing repeat
I look down at my feet
It's a hypnotist's arm
And it works like a charm
But I won't be deprived
Real worlds surreal life
Do or die there is time
Go to sleep you'll be fine
In the morning you'll find
Real life was such a grind
Off I go day is done
Where a new one's just begun
This could be the day that we push through
It could be the day that all our dreams come true
For me and you
Till we're at the end of just another day
Are you too terrified to try your best
Just to end up with an educated guess
Like success
Like those times you wake up mystified
Oh it feels so real in my sleep
Never felt something so close I couldn't keep
Into the day the strangest feeling
Do you really live without the fear
Everything is changing
And there's nothing I can do
My world is turning pages
While I am just sitting here
Well am I getting closer
Will I ever get there
Does it even matter
Do I really need it
Wish that I'd remember
And I'm on the outcome This could be the day that we push through
Did I really want it
Does it really matter It could be the day that all our dreams come true
It was only yesterday
Didn't even know you Oh it feels so real in my sleep never felt so good so close I do
Now I'm gonna miss you
Nothing ever changes
No matter how long you do your hair
It's the same to everyone else
Everything is changing
I guess I should warn my mom
But she'll just be excited
Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong
How optimism led me astray
Two hundred things I took the wrong way
But I saw her love gauge running low
I tried to fill but it overflowed
Feels like my life is ready to blow
Me and my love we'll take it slow
I hope she knows that I'll love her long
I just don't know where the hell I belong
She remembers my name
Could be blown way out
It's all going to change
She remembers my name
But she was only messing around
Please no more playing with my heart
Ooh go with Mr Right just for once
Ooh no more mischief with my mind
Then it all just came out
Guess I'll hold it in next time
No more getting it wrong
I'll be frozen here on
If forever we'll see
But no more guessing for me
Oh I was just so sure of everything
Ooh that's what you get for dreaming aloud
Then it all just came out
Guess I'll hold in now on
If forever we'll see
But no more guessing for me
But that's only when I think of you
Some vision that I hold on to
You know it's everything I do
You know it's everything I do
Can almost stand competing with the others
Can almost hear the fun that I should be having
Instead of all this dreaming
But it's only when I think of you
The mover I could turn into
There must be something I can do
There must be something I can do
I just don't know how to feel right
A beautiful girl is wasting my life
I'm playing a part as somebody else
While trying so hard to be myself
I just need to hear somebody say
That this will make sense one day
I guess I'm alright but they're all doing so well
What I would give to be under that spell
You'll know soon
You'll know soon
You'll know soon
You'll know soon
But you don't know the truth
I'm in love with you
You just don't believe
Anything I do
In so many ways I'm somebody else
I'm trying so hard to be myself
I just need to hear somebody say
That this will all make sense one day
Well it's getting late
I'd better go
I made it this far
As far as I know
Out of this zone
Trying to see
I'm so alone
Nothing for me
I guess I'll go home
Try to be sane
Try to pretend
None of it happened
Oh this old tree
Lonely old me
Whoops-a-daisy
I thought I was happy
Out of this zone
Now that I see
I don't need them
And they don't need me
I guess I'll go home
Try to be sane
Try to pretend
None of it happened
Destined to be
Lonely old me
Whoops-a-daisy
I thought I was happy
Ah why won't they talk to me I thought I was happy
Ah why won't they talk to me I thought I was happy
Ah why won't they talk to me I thought I was happy
Ah why won't they talk to me Aah aah
Ah why won't they talk to me
But I don't really care about it anyway
I wouldn't listen to a word any others say
They just talk about themselves all day
One day I'll be a star and they'll be sorry
Ah why won't they talk to me
Ah why won't they talk to me
Ah why won't they talk to me
Ah why won't they talk to me Aah aah
Ah why won't they talk to me
It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says Go ahead
I got my hopes up again oh no not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
I know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
But I hear it inside my head all day
Then I realize I'm just holding on to the hope that maybe your feelings don't show
It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says Go ahead
Then I got my hopes up again oh no not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
Seed of all this indecision isn't me oh no
'Cause I decided long ago if that's the way it seems to go
We draw us apart to get to something real it feels
It feels like I only go backwards darling
Every part of me says Go ahead
I got my hopes up again oh no not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says Go ahead
I got my hopes up again oh no not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says Go ahead
I got my hopes up again oh no not again
Feels like we only go backwards darling
All I give are little clues
Maybe one day I'll get through
But there is nothing I can do
I'll just keep on lying to you
I only need to say it's true
Only heart already knew
But there is nothing you can do
I just keep on lying to you
Should my cover ever blow
Would you ever let it go
There is something you should know
But hell if I'd ever let it show
So here I am trying to be strong
It was noon and my shadow was long
I guess I'll go and tell you just as soon as I
Get to the end of this song
To the end of this song
to the end of this song
To the end of this song
to the end of this song
The curse has won again
Soon I'll be alone
Take all you can
Please understand
That it never really was love
Well he feels like an elephant
Shaking his big grey trunk for the hell of it
He knows that you're dreaming about being loved by him
Too bad your chances are slim
And it's not like Mister Shook
To get shy when they ask him who is under
There must be something deep down in the dark down there
He's not too easily scared
He's got friends but they got the fear
Wouldn't care too much if he just disappeared
Oh look hey there he is now coming down the stairs
Here it comes
He pulled the mirrors off his Cadillac yeah
'Cause he doesn't like it looking like he looks back
He talks like his opinion is a simple fact
Somebody grabbed his collar
He cried the whole way home
Nobody remembered a thing when they saw him again
That's how it is 'til the end yeah
But she just won't believe me
She just won't believe me
I'd never be deceiving
But she just won't believe me
Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
I have just been waiting for the perfect time to tell you I don't know
Maybe I'm just reading into it a little deeper than I should
We would make it easy we would take it slowly if only we could
Hey what are you doing out here
You're thinking about everything aren't you
I know it's crazy but just don't think of it like that
Nothing has to mean anything
Come on come back inside
Elodie look at me
Unless you're trying to hurt me
Heavy blow down I go
Now I just want to let go
Is it right Is it wrong
I don't know
It's not the cause I'm fighting for
Anymore
But it sucks to keep on running
Eventually there will be
A time for clearer thinking
For now I weep can't get to sleep
I try to hold a good feeling
I just get one here it comes
There it goes
And we just might lose the fight yeah
But it's alright
It wasn't our decision
Nothing that has happened so far has been anything we could control
I have just been waiting for the perfect time to tell you that I know
Every man is happy until happiness is suddenly a goal
I'll just be here waiting till the doctor calls and then I'll let you know
All those things I ever thought
Would never end
To think they're now all memories
Sends me round the bend
To watch her airplane swaying
Coming in to land
There my world is hanging
In someone else's hands
And if I have done something
And you have to let me go
Think of me as someone
Someone that you know
But if I don't hear something
Pretty soon from now
I'll disconnect completely
See how that works out
I wasn't daring
Not much a chancer
Oh my darling
Why won't you answer
7:00 AM
Midnight in Dover
Sun's coming up now
I guess it's over
Playing his guitar
He's dying of cancer
Oh my father
Why won't you answer
7:00 AM
Midnight in Dover
Sun's coming up now
I guess it's over
Senses taking over thought to set me free
I tried to get up but it was pouring down on me
Keeps on getting deeper desperately to be
Said there's some guy interested in dragging it out of me
Oh it's what I need oh
Tell me you're in love to let it show
Just making magic I was far enough to see it
Better than to get just what a stranger did to me
Is it because I love is it because I don't well I just don't know
Keep on asking me darling let me see it keep on asking
Is there any way to let it go
Why do they say they don't know what's right for me
Hey I know what's right for me
Why do they say they don't know what's right for me
Hey I know what's right for me
I know what's right
I know what's right
I know what's right for me
I know what's right
I know what's right
I know what's right for me
For me
I know what's right for me
I know what's right for me
I know what's right for me
I know what's right for me
