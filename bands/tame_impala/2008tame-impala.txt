Feel it come I don't know
How long it's gonna
Stay with me oh I'll let
Desire be desire go
Oh dare I face the real world
Every day back and forth what's it for
What's it for Back and forth everyday
Every day back and forth what's it for
I don't know I'll get out won't have to
Check my watch I don't have
The verve to belong to
This dead side oh why I
Ever tried I don't know
Oh dare I face the real world
Every day back and forth what's it for
What's it for Back and forth everyday
Every day back and forth what's it for
I don't know I'll forget try to let desire be desire go
Feel feel it come
Feel it come
I feel it come I don't know
How long it's gonna
Stay with me oh I'll let
Desire be desire go
Now that all these walls are down wonder what I'll tell you
You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth one day will die
Count the number of beings you are see how long it takes you
You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth one day will die
You can do what you want as long
As the cotton is high and strong
We should be like this all the time
For the Earth one day will die
Said you wouldn't be home late tonight
I gave up waiting at seventeen past midnight
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
It's been so long since I held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be
I thank god I've been blessed with a patient mind
Because what I want to happen won't happen in a very long time
Now my only company's a half full glass of wine
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
You leave me no choice but to plot my revenge
It's been so long since I held your hand
You don't know how hard it can be
Lazy bones and no concern sees forty one mosquitoes flying in formation
I'm all right but my pet cockroach died of starvation
Sleep till late I won't mind if we do nothing today
Come and stay bring your friends who needs floor space anyway
So do you not want me to come over
So do you not want me to come over
Not much we know so off we go
Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah
The other side of the land they like my brain they don't waste time and they don't wait
They can do what they want as long as I don't have to concentrate
Broken drums thriving dreams not much else between these walls
One more spliff I am already gone but duty calls
So do you not want me to come over
So do you not want me to come over
Not much we know so off we go
Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah ah-ah
When I get up I've dreamt too long
Everything else is half as strong
I could see though outside my head
They got it right I got it wrong
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her
Shook off her optimistic hand
I am too fixed on what I've planned
Who is the one who can't let go
I will miss out hell don't I know
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Fear that has fouled all the love I could bring her
I've let too much of it slide through my fingers
Save your fragile mama's heart
And though she will come for you
But I wander
And I wonder
Just how far will you need to be
For shaking talk so easily
For hours on end I wander
Still I don't even know her
Feel just like I need to be
Back where I was
Before I couldn't do that
And I wander
And I wonder
Just how far will you need to be
For shaking talk so easily
For hours on end I wander
Still I don't even know
How it keep a lid on me
How it keep a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me
And I wonder
Just how far will you need to be
For shaking tough so easily
For hours on end I wander
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me and I wonder
How it keeps a lid on me just how far will you need to be
How it keeps a lid on me for shaking tough so easily
How it keeps a lid on me for hours on end I wonder
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me
How it keeps a lid on me
