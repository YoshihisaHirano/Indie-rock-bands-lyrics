I wanted her I wanted her
But she doesn't like the life that I lead
She doesn't like the life that I lead
Doesn't like sand stuck on her feet
Or sitting around smoking weed
I must seem more like a friend in need
And I boast that it is meant to be
But in all honesty I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move
And in all honesty I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move
And she doesn't like the friends that I make
Doesn't make friends for friendship's sake
She just gets bored sitting by the lake
Her soul won't surface and her heart won't ache
And I boast that it is meant to be
But in all honesty I don't have a hope in hell
I'm happy just to watch her move
And I thought they could cure his disease
But in all honesty he didn't have a hope in hell
Now we'll never see him move
Feel it come I don't know
How long it's gonna
Stay with me oh I'll let
Desire be desire go
Oh dare I face the real world
Every day back and forth what's it for
What's it for Back and forth everyday
Every day back and forth what's it for
I don't know I'll get out won't have to
Check my watch I don't have
The verve to belong to
This dead side oh why I
Ever tried I don't know
Oh dare I face the real world
Every day back and forth what's it for
What's it for Back and forth everyday
Every day back and forth what's it for
I don't know I'll forget try to let desire be desire go
Feel feel it come
Feel it come
I feel it come I don't know
How long it's gonna
Stay with me oh I'll let
Desire be desire go
Said the voice from afar
Don't you know it doesn't have to be so hard
Waiting for everyone else around to agree might take too long
Might take too long
Then it won't be so hard It won't be so hard
Well it's true yes but you won't get far telling me
That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from our dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do
Oh alter ego
Get them to love you
While they may depending on your heart and wealth
The only one who's really judging you is yourself
Nobody else nobody else
If I could part
It wouldn't be so hard It won't be so hard
Well it's true yes but you won't get far telling me
That you are all you're meant to be
When the one from our dream
Is sitting right next to me
And I don't know what to do
Oh alter ego
I know where you went but I don't know how you got there
I know where you went but I don't know how you got there
Silver tongue hill where you talk up what I'd play down
I would speak up but I wouldn't know what to say
Lucidity come back to me
Put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
Oh it's hard to tell it breaks down
There is a will there is a way
Wondering around like spare time never knew it
I might suck fizzle or I might just float away
And we'll go running off tonight
High above where we won't even need to reach the sky
My love oh there will be a change in the air
Nobody will be anybody else
Lucidity come back to me
Put all five senses back to where they're meant to be
Oh where we'll go tiptoe
Tread boldly right down to the lair
Why won't you make up your mind
Give me a sign
Why won't you make up your mind
Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time
Living in my head
You'll be sorry when I
Make up mine instead
Why won't you make up your mind
Give me a sign
Why won't you make up your mind
Give me a sign
Am I wasting my time
Living in my head
You'll be sorry when I
Make up mine instead
Cracks in the pavement underneath my shoe
I care less and less about it and less about you
No one else around to look at me
So I can look at my shadow as much as I please
All the kids that I can't compare to
Making friends like they're all supposed to
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
Space around me where my soul can breathe
I've got body that my mind can leave
Nothing else matters I don't care what I miss
Company's okay solitude is bliss
There's a party in my head and no one is invited
And you will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
Movement doesn't flow
Quite like it does when I'm alone
I'll be the one who's free
You and all your friends can watch me today
Don't ask me how you're supposed to feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
You will never come close to how I feel
Everything you ever told me could have been a lie
We may never have been in love
Stuck on thinking that there is always something to lose
Or a hit from above a hit from above
I don't need what I'm holding on to I wish I knew but meanwhile
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
'Cause everything you ever told me could have been a lie
We may never have been in love
And then I will escape I'll never ever have to see
Another disappointed face no one to please
Every now and then it feels like in all of the universe
There is nobody for me
I told myself I wouldn't care no I wouldn't care
But when she said she'd come 'round
I combed my hair yes I checked my hair
Oh meanwhile meanwhile meanwhile
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Expectation is taking its toll
Fluctuations is making me feel old
Expectation is taking its toll
Fluctuations are aching my soul
Overhead ether flow moment colours run
Time so slow slow
I've never seen the arrow of time fly
So low
And time flows on
But don't remind me of home there's everywhere I'd rather go
It's true that some things have to change
And don't remind me of home or I might notice where I am
It's true that some things have to change
I know some things have to change
It's true that some things have to change
I know some things have to change
And gazing out the window as I ascend into the sky
But I'm the one who's left behind
I'm the one who's left behind
There is nothing that is safe
I know some things have to change
Yeah I do yeah I do
But don't remind me of home in case it isn't quite the same
Shifting shifting shifting aloud like it makes so much difference to me
Huffing puffing marching around like I know how much better it should be
I know it looks like I disagree nine tenths of the time
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
Childhood puppy is old and gruff your mother wants to give him away
Pillar of strength was lifted off his deathbed three weeks ago today
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
But I don't really mind
I could never see your eyes
And I can't see past the lies
Which is why I still run for us
In the meantime here comes the chorus
I know you like your own kind
And that pulls me out of line
Which is why I get drunk to make up for a long time
Well I'm drunk and I feel fine yeah I feel fine
