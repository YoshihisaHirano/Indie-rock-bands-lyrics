One more year
One more year
One more year
One more year
One more year
One more year
One more year
One more year
Do you remember We were standing here a year ago
Our minds were racin' time went slow
If there was trouble in the world we didn't know
If we had a care it didn't show
But now I worry our horizons bear nothing new
'Cause I get this feeling and maybe you get it too
We're on a roller coaster stuck on its loop-de-loop
'Cause what we did one day on a whim will slowly become all we do
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
I know we promised we'd be doing this 'til we die
And now I fear we might
Oh now I fear we might
But it's okay
I think there's a way
Why don't we just say One more year
One more year
Not worrying if I get the right amount of sleep
One more year
Not caring if we do the same thing every week
One more year
Of living like I'm only living for me
One more year
Of never talking about where we're gonna be
One more year
One more year
Of living like the free spirit I wanna be
We got a whole year
One more year fifty-two weeks seven days each
One more year four seasons one reason
One way one year
One more year one year one year
From today
From today
Day
Day
I never wanted any other way to spend our lives
Now one of these is gonna be the last for all time
For all time
One more year
One more year
I'm about to do something crazy no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm
This traffic doesn't seem quite as annoying
Quite alright quite alright sittin' here
Yes reminiscent I think this is different
I know this is different I'm about to
Let's cause something permanent
Just so we know we can
I'm about to do something crazy no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
Did you say And here comes forever
Oh here forever let go of me with open arms
We'll be lovers until the end of time I'm about to
I see it now
I see just how you're so right I'm about to
You're so clear now
I'm about to do something crazy no more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm
Let's drink this magic potion
Of love and devotion
And then let's see how it goes
Ah
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time for somethin'
How was I to know
How was I to know this high came rushing
We're on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Possibly a sign
I'm gonna have the strangest night on Sunday
There I go
Quite a show for a loner in LA
Askin' how I managed to end up in this place
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline
Dangerously far and all forgiven
There's gonna be a fight
Gonna be a price to pay on Monday
If you and I get comfortable
We're on the borderline on the borderline
Caught between the tides of pain and rapture
Then I saw the time saw the time
Watched it speedin' by like a train
Like a train
Will I be known and loved
Is there one that I trust
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough
Will I be known and loved
Little closer close enough
I'm a loser loosen up
Set it free must be tough
Will I be known and loved
Is there one that I trust
If there's room room for doubt
As within as without ya
Will I be so in love
Gettin' closer close enough
Shout out to what is done
RIP here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
Gone a little far
Gone a little far this time with something
How could I have known
How was I to know this life get no shame
I said Come with me outside
I need to clear my mind
This weight is crushing
Do you see the light oh
Coming from their eyes oh no
And I couldn't get away
We're on the borderline
Gets me every time
These close encounters
Just to know I can just to know I can
Once again I am alone
Will I be known and loved
Is there one that I trust
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough
Will I be known and loved
Little closer close enough
I'm a loser loosen up
Set it free must be tough I was fine without ya
Will I be known and loved
LA really messed me up
And it isn't cut and dry
Conversation well I tried I was fine without ya
Will I be Stay right here
Any closer bad idea
Shout out to what is done
RIP here comes the sun I was fine without ya
Will I be known and loved
Is there one that I trust
Starting to sober up
Has it been long enough
Ever since I was a small boy
No one else compared to you no way
I always thought heroes stay close
Whenever troubled times arose
I didn't know
Ain't always how it goes
Every single word you told me
I believed without a question always
To save all of us you told us both to trust
But now I know you only saved yourself
Did you think I'd never know
Never wise-up as I grow
And you could store an ocean in the holes
In any of the explanations that you gave
And while you still have time you had a chance
But you decided to take all of your sorrys to the grave
Did you think I'd never know
Never wise-up as I grow
Did you hope I'd never doubt
Never wander work it out
You were runnin' for cover
Doin' like any other
Fallin' out with a lover
You didn't know that I'd suffer
What a thing to discover
There was time to recover
One on one with each other
Just a boy and a father
What I'd give for another
Everything that I have
Couldn't need this for long
Never speak of the time
That you left us alone
Me and Steve on our own
I wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Learn the words sing along
This time wanna tell you 'bout the time
I was I was in Abbey Road
Or the or the time that I had
I had Mick Jagger on the phone
I thought of you when we spoke
Wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
Hear your voice sing along
I wanna say it's alright
You're just a man after all
And I know you have demons
I got some of my own
Think you passed them along
Wanna tell you 'bout the time
Wanna tell you 'bout my life
Wanna play you all my songs
And hear your voice sing along
If you think I couldn't hold my own believe me I can
Believe me I can believe me I can
If ain't so awful and we're all together I can
Believe me I can believe me I can
If you think I couldn't row it up believe me I can
Believe me I can believe me I can
If I dearly wish you'd feel like this forever I can
Believe me I can believe me I can
It just so seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper should you need to come undone
And let those colors run
It just so now you're having fun
So do this and get through this and come find me when you're done
So we can be as one
If you think I couldn't hold my own believe me I can
Believe me I can believe me I can
If you need someone to tell you that you're special I can
Believe me I can believe me I can
If you need someone to carry on believe me I can
Believe me I can believe me I can
If you think the world is feeling what you're feeling I am
Believe me I am believe me I am
And the groove is slow
It just so seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper should you need to come undone
And let those colors run
Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this and come find me when you're done
So we can be as one
'Til the mornin'
'Til the mornin'
Oh
And the groove is slow
'Til the mornin'
And the groove is slow
Seems you're coming on
Breathe a little deeper should you need to come undone
And let those colors run
Now you're having fun
So do this and get through this and until we see the sun
You're my number one
'Til the mornin'
It just so
And the groove is slow
'Til the mornin'
And the groove is slow
We're both adults but we behave like children
Long as we got enough to keep on livin'
'Til the mornin'
'Til the mornin'
There's no use in trying to relate
To that old song
And no use trying to debate
That they've got it wrong
There's no use pining for love
When you're on your own
And no use crying outside
If nobody's home
There's no use flying to the moon
If they won't believe
So why do I go on
On repeat
I was blind by your memory
Like it's someone else like it wasn't me
And there's every chance I'll be there and past
And the day will come and then it will pass
I taught you wrong
When I say I won't
And the more I try not to say what's wrong with us
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust
There's no use trying to relate
To that old song
And no use biding your time
If the bill has come
I was blind by your memory
Like it's someone else like it wasn't me
And there's every chance I'll be movin' fast
And the day will come and then it will pass
Sympathy for the fall now
Fragile life feelin' sore now
In my seat gettin' worn out
Endlessly 'round the corner
And the more I try not to say what's wrong with us
And in the air of today is tomorrow's dust
I close my front door and turn on the light
I let out a breath and hold in a sigh
Ain't nothin' new ain't that much inside
And if I'm counting days dream fruition in what it's looking like
But strictly speaking I'm still on track
Strictly speaking I'm holding on
One other minor setback
But strictly speaking I'm still on track
And all of my dreams are still intact
'Cause strictly speaking I've got my whole life
I lost the wheel a while back
But strictly speaking I'm still on track
Tragedies falling in my lap
Strung out again but still on track
I know it's unrealistic over-optimistic
I know I tried before this I know it's nearly August
I know I can't ignore this looking forward to all this
Sayin' Babe I just adore this but babe can we afford this
I know it's been a slow year nothin' much to show here
I didn't really go for it so not a lot to show for it
The hardest part is over adjusting makes it slower
So glad you're coming over a word to bring us closer
The world ain't changin' for you nothin' to pass it over
We're just now shooting over the rest comes easy
The rest comes easy
'Cause love's like that
But strictly speaking I'm still on track
Strictly speaking I'm holding back
Troubles keep falling in my lap
Yeah yeah but strictly speaking I'm still on track
So tell everyone I'll be alright
'Cause strictly speaking I've got my whole life
One of my major setbacks
But strictly speaking I'm still on track yeah
The hardest part is over adjusting makes it slower
So glad you're coming over a word to bring us closer
The world ain't waitin' for you nothin' to pass it over
We're just now getting over the rest gets easy
The rest gets easy
When we were livin' in squalor wasn't it heaven
Back when we used to get on it four out of seven
Now even though that was a time I hated from day one
Eventually terrible memories turn into great ones
So if they call you
Embrace them
If they hold you
Erase them
'Cause it might've been something who's to say
Does it help to get lost in yesterday
And you might've missed something don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been diggin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might've been something don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
Matty said life didn't go the way that he planned it
Said Oh what I'd give to start over boy I'd command it
So what was I ever afraid of Why did I worry
And why was I ever so brainless Head in a flurry
'Cause they call you
Embrace them
If they stall you
Erase them
'Cause it might've been something who's to say
Does it help to get lost in yesterday
And you might've missed something don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
And you're gonna have to let it go someday
You've been pickin' it up like Groundhog Day
'Cause it might've been something don't say
'Cause it has to be lost in yesterday
If it calls you
Embrace it
If it haunts you
Face it
I know it's mad I understand
It's only snakes and ladders
The period you never had
There's only one that matters
And if it calls you
Embrace it
If it holds you
Erase it
Erase it
We were hangin' in the morning
Feelin' all different kinds of things
We were talkin' about everything
From the past to the happenin'
We started talkin' 'bout devotion
The kind that goes on eternally
And I tell her I'm in love with her
But how can I know that I'll always be
She just said Is it true Is it true Tell me now
It's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I in some kind of mood I don't know I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room here I am back again
She's in my
I was happy just listening
No intention to be mentioning
We started talkin' 'bout the future
'Bout the notion I was motioning
I'm just so terrified to face her
Like any moment I might wake up
'Cause she's the only thing I think of
I don't know nothing but I love her
She just said Is it true Is it true Tell me now
It's a promise I can't make and I won't validate
Was I being immature I don't know I don't care
Now I'm sleeping in my room here I am back again
She's in my
In my
I said We'll see
We'll see
In my
We'll see
Oh we'll see
We'll see
We'll see we'll see we'll see
See how we go
Until we know what the future holds
Ah we'll see
We'll see
We'll see we'll see we'll see
Something doesn't feel right
That's enough for one night
Hope y'all get home alright
There I go blame it on the weather
But hey there's nothin' wrong
I'm only tired of all these voices
Always sayin' Nothin' lasts forever
It might be time to face it
It ain't as fun as it used to be no
You're goin' under
You ain't as young as you used to be
It might be time to face it
You ain't as cool as you used to be no
You won't recover
You ain't as young as you used to be
It might be time to face it
It might be time to face it
I've been lost before
So tell me it's not over
'Cause I finally got somethin' goin'
And suddenly all my friends are growin' up
And movin' on
I must be missin' somethin'
'Cause I just wanna keep this dream alive for now
Don't they know nothin' lasts forever
It might be time to face it
Nobody knows what you've come here for no
You're goin' under
They roll their eyes when you're at the door
It might be time
It might be time to face it
You may as well embrace it
We promise to come visit yeah
It might be time
It might be time to face it yeah
You ain't as fun as you used to be
You won't recover
You ain't as cool as you used to be
It might be time to face it
It might be time to face it
It's like Oh bass cool
You know how you make the bass better
Crank the bass up yeah
You wanna make the kick drum better
Just crank the bass up
And it's like No not really
I just wanna let it go
I just wanna let it go
I just wanna let it go
I just wanna let it go
I just wanna let it go
I just wanna let it go
Just a moment
Right before all the sunlight ends
Wasn't brave enough to tell you
There ain't gonna be another chance
It's not done until
One more hour
And everything's still
One more hour
Minutes erasing
Whatever I've done
I did it for love
I did it for fun
Couldn't get enough
I did it for fame
But never for money
Not for houses
Not for her
Not for my future children
Until now
How could I love again
How could I ever ask for more
Into the road ahead
Into a life I can't ignore
Lose her how could I love again
Leave her how could I love this path for sure
Don't
Lose her with no more time to spare
Rumor I know the answer more and more
As long as I can
Long as I can
Spend some time alone
As long as I can
Long as I can
Be the man I am
Oh life is strange
One more hour
I could wait
One more hour
As long as I can
As long as I can
Spend some time alone
As long as I can
As long as I can
Remember who I am
As long as I can
As long as I can
Spend some time alone
As long as I can
As long as I can
Be the man I am
Just a minute weather up before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute there
One more hour and you know your life is one to share
Just a minute baby right before we go through here
All these people said we wouldn't last a minute here
I'm with you and I can run until we'll not be here
Just a minute weather up before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute there
One more hour and you know your life is one to share
Just a minute baby right before we go through here
All these people said we wouldn't last a minute here
I'm with you and I can run until we'll not be here
Just a minute weather up before you go out there
All your voices said you wouldn't last a minute there
I'm about to do something crazy
No more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami
Go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm
This traffic doesn't seem quite as annoying
Quite alright quite alright sittin' here
Yes reminiscent I think this is different
I know this is different
Let's cause somethin' permanent
Just so we know we can
I'm about to do something crazy
No more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We'll be sayin' And here comes forever
All hell for later
Let go of me with open arms
We'll be lovers
Until the end of time
I see it now
I see just how you're so right
It's so clear now
I'm about to do something crazy
No more delayin'
No destiny is too far
We can get a home in Miami
Go and get married
Tattoo your name on my arm
Let's drink this magic potion
Of love and devotion
And then let's see how it goes
