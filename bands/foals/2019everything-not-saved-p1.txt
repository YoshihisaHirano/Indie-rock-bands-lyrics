I walked into the desert
I walked out of the past
You were ridin' in a black hole
To sing the songs at the table again
I walked into the desert
I walked into the dawn
You came to me in the black hole
To right all I've said and done
Belong with our own
Belong with our own
Belong with our own
Belong with our own
Oh
Oh
Now the sea eats the sky
But they say it's a lie
And there's no birds left to fly
We'll hide out
The weather is against us
We build houses underground
And flowers upside down
In our dreams
In the eye of the storm
In the land where you were born
We try to make no sound
We hide out
'Cause they watch us in sleep
And the language that we speak
And the secrets that we keep
In our dreams in our dreams in our dreams
In our dreams in our dreams in our dreams
I said I'm so sorry
To have kept you waiting around
I wish I could've come up
I could've shouted out loud
But they got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down
In a world upside down
Oh to dream this all off
In the islands of the mind
The places they can't find
We'll hide out
Then the black sky came down
The cities underground
The flowers upside down
In our dreams
Oh to meet you again
To pass you on the stairs
To see you everywhere
In my dreams
'Cause they watch us in sleep
And the language that we speak
And the secrets that we keep to ourselves
In our dreams in our dreams in our dreams
In our dreams in our dreams in our dreams
I said I'm so sorry
To have kept you waiting around
I wish I could've come up
I could've shouted out loud
But they got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down
I said I'm so sorry
That the world has fallen down
I wish I could do something more
I could shout it out loud
They got exits covered
All the exits underground
I wish I could figure it out
But the world's upside down
In a world upside down
Oh upside down
Oh upside down
Oh upside down
Back to the days of yore when we were sure of a good long summer
I hope you could be found out of ground our long lost brother
We share all of our dreams into the screen but not with each other
Back to the days of yore when we were sure of a good long summer
I hope you could be found out of ground our long lost brother
We share all of our dreams into the screen but not with each other
Back to the days of yore when we were sure of a good long summer
I see you lie I see you lay I see you there
Oh oh
I'll fight for it I'll fight for it I'll fight for it
Oh oh
I see you there I see you there I see you there
Oh oh
You keep me there you keep me there you keep me there
Oh oh
It's getting late now my head goes kaboom
Escape from this room and I'll wait for a wave
To come wash away keep me out of this place
I'm far from rare don't keep me there
Don't keep me there I'm far from rare
I see your legs I see your legs I see your legs
Oh oh
I break the cage I break the cage I break the cage
Oh oh
I'm hearing things I'm hearing things I'm hearing things
Oh oh
I break the cage I break the cage I break the cage
Oh oh
I see you lie I see you lay I see you there
Oh oh
I'll fight for it I'll fight for it I'll fight for it
Oh oh
I see you there I see you there I see you there
Oh oh
I see you there I see you there I see you there
Oh oh
We're caught up in silence
I lose you in degrees
I see you through the glass doors
I've looked up and down now
But lose you in degrees
Come back around my way again
See me if you please
But we're tongue-tied in silence
Our words lost on the breeze
Caught up in your orbit still
Release me if you please
I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Only me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Only me on my knees
I saw the black rain pouring
A lost love on display
Bit by bit and day by day
I know we've lost our way
And I hear final footsteps
Lost you by degrees
I pressed up to the glass wall
I couldn't watch you leave
I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Only me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Don't leave me on my knees
I lose you in degrees
Only me on my knees
Around again
I've waste my days
Around again
I waste my time
Oh I know I've wasted time around again
When I've tried to please yeah waste my days
How did I end up here around again
Where I've come to be yeah waste my time
Oh I see I've wasted time around again
When I've tried to please yeah waste my time
Miss me when I waste my time around again
Where I've come to be yeah
Am I wasting my time
I could not persevere
No more wasting my time
How can I persevere
Wrap me up in goodbyes
Old Sargasso sky
'Cause I'm about to take flight
Please don't ask me why
If the devil wants me
Tell him I got high
'Cause life is what you make it
You got yours and I got mine
When the end comes my way
Will I drop to my knees and pray
And if my parents ask you
Tell them I'll be okay
And now the robots have made the rounds
Sand dunes filled up all our towns
The foxes howl and the creepers prowl around
The peeling wet bricks of London town
Foxes howl and the way men cower
Won't you find a way for me somehow
So let's get dirt on an Oxford shirt
Throw a party so we won't get hurt
See you frown through your evening gown
When I fall from the wagon
Twisted frown from the businessmen
Won't you find a way from me somehow
When I fall from the wagon
Hiding from the businessmen
Won't you find a way from me somehow
I tried to make a call to heaven
Phone lines cut back in '97
Radio silence all the way down
The robots make all the paper rounds
And all the kids have left the towns
Foxes howl and the preachers bow down
When I fall from the wagon
Twisted frown from the businessmen
Won't you find a way from me somehow
When I fall from the wagon
Hiding from the businessmen
Won't you find a way from me somehow
When I was a latchkey kid on the Lunar
A free-from-guilt born baby boomer
Can you pick me up a little bit sooner
I'm waiting all day all day
When I wasting my days at the lotto
I was picking my teeth with a biro
I was keeping it cool with cryo
Waiting all day all day
Agitator extricater
Won't you come evacuator
Infiltrator hesitater
Won't you come emancipator
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
When I was a Kung-Fu kid on the Lunar
I was moonin' at the Bella Luna
Trump clogging up my computer
But I'm watching all day all day
They say that hell is other people
But the other side's there for evil
Please don't let there be a sequel
'Cause I'm watching all day all day
Agitator extricater
Won't you come evacuator
Infiltrator hesitater
Won't you come emancipator
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
We had it all but we didn't stop to think about it
We had it all but we didn't stop to think about it
We had it all but we didn't stop to think about it
I've had a wild one I've had a wild one
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
A day in the life of
When I was a Kung-Fu kid on the Lunar
I was moonin' at the Bella Luna
Trump clogging up my computer
I'm watching all day all day
You see through me in time
And I ride white horses on hills
I long for you
All through bleeding June
Will I reach silent seas
I wait on the white hills
In ropes that unwind
So what does life loan you again
A long time
Salt-eyed starless nights
Time loans you again give me one more time
One more just give me one more time
Time incoming life becoming
Time incoming I'm coming in
Time incoming life becoming
Time incoming ropes unwinding
When I wait when I wait
Time incoming life becoming in
Ropes unwinding time becoming in
Life becoming in oh I coming in
Times incoming life becoming
Ropes unwinding
Time has come and time has gone
Cities burn
We got youth to spend and time to waste in love
To live again my friend
Through the flames and through the fire
Cities burn
We don't give a damn
'Cause we got all our friends right here
We got youth to spend
'Cause time away from me
Is what I need to clear my sight and clear my head
I'm coming down over coming down over
Coming down over
I'll be right there I'm coming down over
Coming down over again
When all is said and all is done
Our fathers run and leave all the damage they've done behind
Left us with the blind leading the blind
And time has come and time is done
Cities burn
We don't give a damn
'Cause we got all our friends right here
We got youth to spend
Time away from me is what I need
To clear my sight and clear my head
I'm coming down over coming down over
Coming down over
I'll be right there I'm coming down over
Coming down over again
Be right there I'll be right there
Down I go I'll scream I'll go down again
I feel my blood I did my time
I'm deep in my head I'm deep in my way
I'm deep in my soul
Here I go
I'll be right there
I'm over it now over it now over it I'm over it
Over it over it over it
Going over it over and over it
Finally over it over it over it
Over and over it over and over it
I mean over it over and over it
Over and over it over and over it
Over it over and over it
Over and over it
Time away from me is what I need
To clear my sight and clear my head clear my head
Clear my head
Clear my head
The fox is dead in the garden
The hedges are on fire in the country lanes
And all I wanna do is get out of the rain
An autumn day an autumn day
My daughter's asleep in the garden
The leaves are on fire in the country lanes
And all I wanna do is get out in the rain
An autumn day an autumn day
I'm done with the world
And it's done with me
All I wanna do is get up and leave
Sun falls into the garden
I'm on my knees
