I buried my heart in a hole in the ground
With the lights and the roses and the cowards downtown
They threw me a party there was no one around
They tried to call my girl but she could not be found
I buried my guilt in a pit in the sand
With the rust and the vultures and the trash downtown
So don't step to me kid you'll never be found
Cause while you were sleeping I took over your town
When I see a man I see a lion
When I see a man I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye of my eye of my eye
You're the apple of my eye of my eye won't ya
I fell for a girl with a port-wine stain
I knew her initials but never her name
I tried and I tried and I was never the same
So no longer through love and I'm forever changed
When I see a man I see a lion
When I see a man I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye of my eye of my eye
You're the apple of my eye of my eye won't ya
Give up my money give up my name take it away
I'll give it away I'll give it away I'll give it
When I see a man I see a lion
When I see a man I see a lion
When I see a man I see a lion
When I see a man I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye of my eye of my eye
You're the apple of my eye of my eye won't ya
Give up my money give up my name take it away
I'll give it away I'll give it away I'll give it
I'm a sycophantic animal I'm a sycophantic animal I'm a sycophantic animal
Break up the chain I'll break up the chain I'll break it
Give it away I'll give it away I'll give it
When I see a man I see a lion
When I see a man I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye of my eye of my eye
You're the apple of my eye of my eye won't ya
Give up my money give up my name take it away
Give it away give it away I'll give it
See you again I'll see you again I'll see ya
Give it away I'll give it away I'll give it
When I feel low when I feel low I feel it
When I see a man I see a lion
When I see a man I see a lion
You're the apple of my eye of my eye of my eye
You're the apple of my eye of my eye won't ya
I see a mountain at my gates
I see it more and more each day
What I give it takes away
Whether I go or when I stay
I see a mountain at my gates
I see it more and more each day
I see a fire out by the lake
I'll drive my car without the brakes
I see a mountain in my way
It's looming larger by the day
I see a darkness in my fate
I'll drive my car without the brakes
Oh gimme some time
Show me the foothold from which I can climb
Yeah when I feel low
You show me a signpost for where I should go
I see a mountain at my gates
I see it more and more each day
And my desire wears a dark dress
But each day I see you less
Oh gimme some time
Show me the foothold from which I can climb
Yeah when I feel low
You show me a signpost for where I should go
Through lanes and stone rows
Black granite wind blows
Fire lake and far flame
Go now but come again
Dark clouds gather 'round
Will I run or stand my ground
Oh when I come to climb
Show me the mountain so far behind
Yeah it's farther away
Its shadow gets smaller day after day
Yeah gimme my way
Gimme my love
Gimme my choice
You keep me coming around
Gimme my fate
Gimme my lungs
Gimme my voice
You keep me coming around
Gimme my lungs
Gimme my gimme my gimme my gimme my
Gimme my gimme my gimme my gimme my gimme my way
Gimme my fate
Gimme my lungs
Gimme my choice
You keep me coming round
The city I was born in I left a long time ago
And we lost touch grew apart my friend
My heart's an old pole dancer troubled romancer you know
It's a subway chancer a question with no answer
Come meet me by the river see how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river see how time it flows
And when we age shed our skin and grow
We shed our layers spread our wings and go
My heart's an old black panther corrupted financer you know
It's a troubled romancer a question with no answer
Come meet me by the river see how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river see how time it flows
Come meet me by the river see how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river see how time it flows
Oh now the river runs away but I chase it yeah
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it yeah
Oh now the river runs away but I chase it yeah
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it yeah
Come meet me by the river see how time it flows
I'll meet you by the river see how time it flows
Oh now the river runs away but I chase it
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it
Oh now the river runs away but I chase it
Time holds no fear when I turn round to face it
Give me something I haven't seen
Give me the red light turning green
Give me the words but not the page
Give me it all
Give me the time but not an age
Give me a look but not the rage
Give me the feel for where I'll go
Give me it all
Give me the way it could have been
Give me the ghost that's on the screen
Give me the way but not the means
Give me it all
Give me something I haven't seen
Give me the red light turning green
Give me the words but not the page
Give me it all
I called you up
3 times last night
Running through the streets
Bloody from a fist fight
Keep you warm
Keep you there
Wanna keep you all
See you there wanna see you some day
As you look back I'm pulling away
You caught the bus and I caught the train
All that remains are words in the rain
Ooooh oooh oooo-oooooh
Ooooh oooh oooo-oooooh
Give me the shade of a thunder cloud
Give me a good-bye said out loud
Give me the day with no memories
Give me it all
I know you could be here with me
By the rain and the palm of the valley
But you're there by the tube stop in the freezing rain
See you there wanna see you some day
As you look back I'm pulling away
You caught the bus and I caught the train
All that remains are words in the rain rain
Ooooh oooh oooo-oooooh
Ooooh oooh oooo-oooooh
So solo I see you there
You fall like a fifty weight
The time goes
I'll be right there
I feel I feel there's a fork in the road
Oh-Woah-woah
You got an albatross around your neck around your neck
You got a hundred broken lightbulbs above your head
They said that you had it coming but I wouldn't bet
'Cause you got a slowly ticking time bomb
And then you see red
Sunblind sunblind
You got an albatross around your neck around your neck
You got a pile of broken wishbones under your bed
And you got a hungry green-eyed monster that you keep fed
And it keeps on coming over it wants you dead
Sunblind sunblind
Oh you burnt the lungs that your ancestors created
You sat by the banks of the river and you waited
Till time rolled back and the water had abated
You drank you share but you still could not be sated
Quicksands of the mind and the sinkholes you may find
When you look through the twisting of the vines
The twisting of the vines
Time comes round again it's etching at your bones
Chill wind comes round it's blowing through your home
Quicksands of the mind and the sinkholes you may find
When you look through the twisting of the vines
You burnt the lungs that your ancestors created
You sat by the banks of the river and you waited
Till time rolled back and the water had abated
You drank you share but you still could not be sated
You said you're scared of the clocks that keep ticking over
I'll find a way through a life that we're living over
Again and again through a life that we're living over again and again
A life that we're living over
Again and again again and again and again
Again and again again and again and again
Oh yeah oh yeah
Yay you keep it slow yay-yay you keep it low
Well you sell snake oil to the butcher
The butcher's bill must always be paid
It's a wild wait to wait and it leads to no surprises
No surprise no-one gets laid
You put the snake oil under my tongue
Show me the door the way to be free
Cause you know the moves that only you do
Makes fools of a boy like me ooooh ooooh yay uh
You sell snake oil to the sinners
When all they crave is just to be free
It's a wild tease tease me with nothing better
Nothing better slower than me
You cast a spell that keeps me wired
Keeps me red keeps me on fire
So why do you take me down down to nothing
Always out cold never been higher ooooh ooooh
In the day you leave me to want what I crave
No surprise to want what I can't find
You said it again again again
Come on you said you said it again
Driving through the old county line
Where I go to find what is mine
Driving past the old county line
Where I go to find what is mine ooooh ooooh
You said it again you give it away
In the day you leave me to want what I crave
No surprise you leave me to want what I can't find
Another hot summer's day and only we know the way
To the cool blue lagoon where we sleep until noon
The city is all ablaze with blue notes and haze
We hit the open wide roads we snub the moon and go
Get up again get up again get up again
We swim under the moon in the cool blue lagoon
You count up all my scars and crumble them into stars
You're such a perfect mess you in your dirty white dress
In the day I can see you up there again
Get up again get up again get up again get up again
A perfect blue evening we sit and drink and we sing
Smoke flowers rising high under the flaming sky
I'm on the red-eye flight to nowhere good
How about you
I've been in the air for hours meteor showers by the pool
So one last drink for summer always leaving never you
Come back to London thunder the sound of sorrow in my room yeah
And now the tables turn it's over
And with my fingers burned I start anew
And now I've come back down I'm older
I look for something else to hold on to
There is no way to realign upholster skin I take back every line
Lost my mind in San Francisco the worn out disco when tempers cooled
There is no water there is no sound
Will you come around Will you come around
There is no space there is no time
Where'd you draw the line
And now the tables turn it's over
And with my fingers burned I start a new
And now I've come back down I'm older
I look for something else to hold on to
I'm on the red-eye flight to nowhere good
How about you
It's a new day just in time for me to say I'm sorry
For all the things I said but didn't mean
It's a new time so why must I wait in line for what is mine
It's a new day why must it be the same
Been gone too long so don't wait up it's 3 am I got held up
Tried to call I'm on my way
Will I see you I've got lost in foreign lands
Tried to get back oh I hoped you understand
Just remember the love is a gun in your hand
It's a new year just in time for me to say
I'd be there but didn't make the grade to new time
So why must I wait in line for what is mine
It's a new day always feels the same
Been gone too long so don't wait up it's 3 am I got held up
Tried to call I'm on my way
Will I see you I've got lost in foreign lands
Tried to get back oh I hoped you understand
Wait forever for love is a gun in your hand
In the deep blue I'm a hundred miles from land
Treading water it's too deep for me to stand
Just remember love is a gun in your hand
Just in time for me to say I'm sorry
Why must I wait in line for what is mine
In the deep blue see the whitecaps from the shore
But I can't swim and it keeps me wanting more
Just remember love is a gun in your hand
Will I see you I've got lost in foreign lands
Tried to make it back oh I hoped you understand
Wait forever for love is a gun in your hand
When I come to walk the line the fire may come but we'll be just fine
When I go to walk the line the fire it will come but we'll be just fine
Mouth of the ocean be well spoken watch your P's and Q's
Now that we're older the future is colder but what is there to do
I'll walk the line I'll be just fine I'll be right back on time
The fire is coming but we'll outrun it we'll never be undone
Oh what came of the things we once believed
Oh all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh what came of the things we once believed
Oh all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
And now our parents are long departed who can finish the songs they started
Bodies are broken but it's just a token of what is surely to come
Unstitch the suture please pause the future so I can collect my things
The fire is coming but we'll outrun it we'll never be undone
Oh what came of the things we once believed
Oh all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh what came of the things we once believed
Oh all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
When I go to walk the line the fire it comes but I'll be just fine
Oh what came of the things we once believed
Oh all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh all lost and oh all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
Oh all lost to the depths of a hungry sea
All that's left all that's left is the echo of a roaring sea
Long gone long gone to the trace of a memory
What came of the things I once believed
All that's left all that's left is the trace of a memory
