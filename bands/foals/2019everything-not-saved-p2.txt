Shadow see how far I go
Step by step I'll keep it up I won't slow I gotta go
Through the embers through the rows
Every shadow step I take I'll make sure that I won't break
Show them all just what I know
While the years they come and go I won't let myself get slow
'Cause they all just come and go
Every step that I will take I'll make sure that I won't break
Oh if I fall down fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running
Oh if I fall down fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running
And if it hurts don't let it show
Step by step I'll keep it up I won't slow I gotta go
While the seasons come and go
Every shadow step I take I'll make sure that I won't break
Shadow chiaroscuro
While the years they come and go I won't let myself get slow
When I when I fall down fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running
Oh when I fall down fall down
Won't you know to keep me running
Yeah I keep on running
Well I keep on running
Loneliness of the long distance runner
Shadows come closer so I'll go on further
Loneliness of the long distance runner
Shadows come closer so I'll go on further
Loneliness of the long distance runner
Shadows come closer so I'll go on further
Loneliness of the long distance runner
Shadows come closer so I'll go on further
Oh when I fall down fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running
Oh if I fall down fall down
Then I'll know to keep on running
Fall down when I slow down Keep on running
Slow down Keep on running
Ohh slow down Keep on running
Keep on running
Keep on running
Keep on running
Keep on running
I hope there's a shot in the dark
That if I keep it up I can keep on going
They say that life is short
And it can't be bought by the likes of me
I heard that it won't be long
Until we're gone like dew in the morning
Stop the clocks pull up your socks
Go find a fountain to wash it off
So kill the screen head to Medellin
To shout and scream and find your trouble
Live amongst the orange roses
Pull vogue poses and wash it off
Lord knows I'm in the field hellhounds are back
And on my heels
They said I died last week in the Pacific ocean
No words spoken
Plane fell right out the sky
But they don't know why but don't you worry
'Cause life's a lie so roll the die
Keep on trying to wash it off
Go wash it off
Go wash it off
Go wash it off
Don't you even think of me
'Cause I'll be free beyond the levee
All that's left is a ghost machine
And it can't be reached but you can try
You should go buy the boat
And build a moat untie yourself
Go wash it off
Go wash it off
Go wash it off
You're my ride or die
I just wish I'd said goodbye one last time
One last time
Now all that's left is a ghost machine
It can't be reached it won't be seen again
Seen again
You're my ride or die
And I just wanted to say goodbye
Say goodbye
Now all that's left is a ghost machine
It can't be reached it won't be seen again
Go wash it off go wash it off
Go wash it off go wash it off
Go wash it off go wash it off
Go wash it off wash it off
I gotta rip up the road
I got two nights in a row
Oh we gon' put on a show
With the black bull in tow
I'm in a Holy Ghost zone
I got a trunk full of gold
Don't look at me like that
Don't look at me like this
Can you remember my name
I swear you're all just the same
Oh tu parlais Anglais
Can o' Stella fish fillet
In a foreshortened future
I see you drink your kombucha
And it really doesn't suit ya
And I'm not the waiter
We not playing around
I got a black bull in tow
I call a wolf a wolf
This for real ain't no spoof
I'm breaking bones on the roof
Who me I'm not aloof
For sooth for shame
I done conquered where I came
And I'm a world away
'Cause I'm a man of today
We not playing around
The black bull's in town
The black bull's in town
We not playing around
It's about that time when I gotta throw lightning
I coulda been something without you now
It's about that time when I gotta do something
Gotta be like lightning
Be somebody new now
Like lightning
I know my way back
I've seen that sky collapse
I've heard that thunder clap
I've seen that lightning crack
I know my way home
I'll mend those broken bones
I've seen that lightning crack
Don't just think about yourself
Get some help Go get some help
Coming for you They're coming for you

I thought I saw you dancing with dirty feet
Broken records slightly out of reach
Are you dreaming dreaming about the spires
Back then before there were crossed wires
Are you longing hands up in the air
Broken flowers twisting in your hair
Are you dreaming dreaming about the time
Way back when before you crossed the line
You cut and run
You cut and run
They cut and run
I am the one
Empty rooms dancing on your own
Broken flowers from a broken home
Are you dreaming dreaming about the time
Way back when before you crossed the line
Thought I saw ya dancing with tired feet
Longing hours records on repeat
Are you dreaming dreaming about the spires
Back then before there were crossed wires
You cut and run
When you see the trouble
You cut and run
Once the damage has been done
You cut and run
When you see the trouble
I am the one
'Cause you're always crashing that same car
And the apple don't seem to fall too far
And there's always icebergs in the way
Of all the sorry's that you ought to say
You want to feel like the way that you did back then
You want to push back the hands and start it again
You want to feel like the way that you did back then
You want to push back the hands and start it again
You want to feel like the way that you did back then
You want to push back the hands and start it again
You want to feel like the way that you did back then
You want to push back the hands and start it again
You want to feel like the way that you did back then
You cut and run
When you see the trouble
You cut and run
Once the damage has been done
You cut and run
When you see the trouble
I am the one
'Cause you're always crashing that same car
And the apple don't seem to fall too far
And there's always icebergs in the way
Of all the sorry's that you ought to say
So you don't come back around this town
Always causing trouble or just fooling around
'Cause there's always something in the way
Of all the sorry's that you ought to say
Ooh when I fall through the air
Flew too close to the sun
With my wings all bound and twisted into one
When I fall like a diamond
I'm coal again
Drip through the sky into the infrared
When I fall like leaf
From an autumn tree
Dancing at 10 000 feet come catch me
When I fall through the fire
Into the void again
Ooh I'll burn all the liars burn all the liars
Cold black water rushing in
Fall on the fire just to start again
Cool green water come and mend
Burning star 'bout to come again
Ooh when I burn with a fever
Into the quiet ether
Come and mend me come in quiet come in care
When I'm cut like a diamond
I'm coal again
Turn me into a wedding ring that you can wear
When I fall like leaf
From an autumn tree
Come and dance at 10000 feet with me
Cold black diamond shine again
Fall on the fire just to start again
Burning star 'bout to come again
Cool green water come and mend
If you come again
I'll be sure to send the tide to come meet you
And if I come again
Please be sure to send the Moon to come meet me
I'll eat up all your pain
Take in all the blame
Be that someone to complain to
I'll be like water when you rise
Plant a jasmine in the night
When I return
There's a moon pool on fire
Into the surf again
There's a moon pool in bloom
If you come again
I'll be sure to send the tide to come meet you
And if I come again
Please be sure to send the Moon to come meet me
There's a lighthouse in the dark
A garden in the past
Under bruisings of a night sky
Be like water when I rise
Plant a jasmine in the night
When I return there's a moon pool on fire
Into the surf again
There's a moon pool in bloom
There's a serpent on the beach
If I'm out of reach
Place a garland in the sea for me
When the tide comes rolling in
Please be sure to send
Blood moon for me
A garland in the sea
And if I don't make it home
Wrap the jasmine 'round my bones
Blood moon for me
A garland in the sea
If I don't make it home
Wrap the jasmine 'round my bones
A garland in the sea
A blood moon for me
If I don't make it home
Wrap the jasmine 'round my bones
A garland in the sea
A blood moon for me
If I don't make it home
Wrap the jasmine 'round my bones
A garland in the sea
A blood moon for me
Hey
Now it's time to go
From the white wards of England
Where the crows line the rivers and roads
I wanna walk where I know
Through the olive groves
The sky that knows my name
It gave me away
The magnolia moon
Like an eggshell a white bell
To lighten my cold room
So let me sleep where I lay
With a murder of crows
That live in the bows of my brain
See me when I float like a dove
The skies above are lined with trees
I'm on my knees I'm singing please
Come and take me away
Time brings low all good things
When you open your eyes
When you open your eyes
Now in the vastness of pines
Where my ghost lies in loose-limbed array
I pass the time
Go upload my heart
To the fatal shore
Forever more it spins there
Behind closed doors
Now it's time to go
Through the fields of chrome
The rusted homes abandoned
At the remains of the day
So come row me away
On black rivers and rainbows
To Neptune where I can stay
See me when I float like a dove
The skies above are lined with trees
I'm on my knees begging please
Come and take me away
Come take me away
Come take me away
Time brings low the best of things
When you open your eyes
When you open your eyes yeah
Time brings low all the things
When we open our eyes
When we open our eyes
Oh I waited so long
On the slow shores of England
To sing my last song
To come roll me away
On black rivers and rainbows
To Neptune where I can stay
See me when I float like a dove
The skies above are lined with trees
I'm on my knees I'm begging please
Come and take me away
Come take me away
Come take me away
