Once is too much for me
A thousand never enough
Once is too much for me
A thousand never enough
Once is too much for me
A thousand never enough
Once is too much for me
A thousand never enough
It's never enough
We're coming for you
Sticks and stones don't break my bones you make believe
It's lock and load it's a dead end road to you and me
You know what's to go I'm strict for soul I make believe
And I'm off the rent I haven't spent I guarantee
So can you not go away
If just for one day
Uh-uh-uh
Impossible possible way
How would you do know
How'd you do now
Run away
War sounds in you
Don't throw your fortune away
And I can't get enough
Space space space
Get enough space
I'm pale and coy a mama's boy I make believe
I shimmy-shake I wake and bake I'm over me
My lungs are beat I can not breathe don't follow me
You push and shove I've had enough don't mess with me
So can you not go away
If just for one day
Uh-uh-uh
Impossible á¹—ossible way
How would you do know
How'd you do now
Run away
War sounds in you
Don't throw your fortune away
And I can't get enough
Space
I can't Get enough space
Space
You don't have my number we don't need each other now
We don't need the city the creed or the culture now
'Cause I feel I feel alive I feel I feel alive
I feel the streets are all pulling me down
So people of the city I don't need your counsel now
And I don't need your good advice you don't have my lover's touch
You don't have my number we don't need each other now
The creed or the culture we can move beyond it now
Now the wolf is knocking at my door bang-banging ask for more
Stand here we stand tall we could move beyond these walls
I don't need your counsel I don't need these city streets
I don't need that good advice 'cause we can move beyond it now
You don't have my number we don't need each other now
The creed or the culture you don't have my lover's touch
'Cause I feel I feel alive I feel I feel alive
I feel the streets are all far from there
Do you even hear me Do you even know my name
Can you see the ocean now You don't have my lover's touch
You don't have my number you don't have my number
People can you hear me Are you even listening now
'Cause you don't have my number we don't need each other now
You can't steal my thunder 'cause you don't have my lover's touch
You don't have my number and I don't need no one else
And I don't need these city streets the creed or the culture now
I know
You've fallen again
The way I fell before
Cause I'm a bad loser
When you get your way
And I know that I'll change
I'm chained again
You've lost your way
There's nothing I want today
Cause I'm a bad habit
One you cannot shake
And I hope that I change
Don't follow me
Don't follow me
So I wont
let the flowers grow
Into the deep below
Oh would you forget me now
Still small
Small voice of calm
It's the blame into my arms
Cause I'm a bad habit
One you cannot shake
Oh Mary mercy
Would you pray for me
Would you pray for me
So I wont
Let the flowers grow
Into the deep below
Oh would you forget me now
And if I could
Make the days of pain
Wash the stains away
Oh would you forget me now
Ahhhh
Cause I made my mistakes
And I feel something's changed
And I know what's at stake
Wash the stains away
So I wont
Let the flowers grow
Into the deep below
Oh would you forget me now
And if I could
Take the pain away
Wash the stains away
Oh would you forgive me now
I made my mistakes
And I feel something's changed
Wash the stains away
And I feel quite okay
Come run this way run this way
Follow I promise you'll be OK come this way
Be that way be that way
Want you I need you to be OK what do they know
I know you're bothered down oh you're bothered down
I know I'm trapped oh yeah trapped
With every time I see you I want to sail away
With every time I see you I want to sail away
Through the night that sounds great
I know it'll be OK just come this way
Your feet on the dash you make me crash
See you go flying into the night forever is past
Do they bother down Do they bother now
Oh you're trapped oh you're trapped
With every time I see you I want to sail away
With every time I see you I want to sail away
The lights won't bridge the gap through their holiday
With every time I see you I want to sail away just sail away
Everytime now everytime now
Anytime anytime everytime now
With every time I see you I want to sail away
With every time I see you I want to sail away
The lights won't bridge the gap through their holiday
With every time I see you I want to sail away just sail away
Oh I hope that you somebody
someone I could count
To pull me to my feet again
when I was in doubt
Oh now Mama do you hear me
I'm calling out your name
Oh now Mama do you hear me
I'm calling out your name
I'm calling out your name
I'm the last cowboy in this town
Empty veins and my plastic broken crown
They said I swam the sea that ran around
They said I once was lost but now I'm truly found
And I know the place another way
I feel I feel no shame
Oh now Mama do you hear my fear
It's coming after me
I'm calling out your name
I'm calling out your name
Stay with me stay with me
Did you throw your heart away
Oh I know just what I say
Did your phone cut in the way
Being still downtown I say
And I know you ran away
oh I know but I'm feeling okay
And I found love and fear won't go
and I found love and feeling won't go
See you walk away feeling okay now
happy now happy now
Stay with me stay with me stay with me stay with me
It's times like these when I'm on my way out of the woods
Never felt better than when I'm on my way out for good
It's times like these when I'm on my way back out of the woods
I'll never be afraid again now I'm out of here for good
It was just a dream
The most beautiful place I've seen
The white caps and the pines
Ripped our nations in the sea
It's times like these when I'm on my way back out of the woods
I've never felt better than when I'm on my way out for good
Now I've finally found
All my friends are in the clouds
Alone now in my head now
All alone now in my head
It's times like these when I'm on my way back out of the woods
I've never felt better than when I'm on my way out for good
Now I've finally found
All my friends are in the clouds
Alone now in my head now
All alone now in your head
And I've waited just so long
To sing you this final song
Time keeps ticking time keeps pushing time keeps rolling along
Oh I know you're still with me
You my compass and my sea
And I know you're still with me
You my compass and my sea
Oh I hope you can hear me
Follows billion miles away
You stay
Cause I love you dearly
Follows billion miles away
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're the only thing I need
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're the only thing I need
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're the only thing I need
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're my only friend indeed
Green broken glass ocean
You break me slow motion
No map no message
It's the deep blue screen I know
Cause I know you're still with me
You my compass and my sea
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're the only thing I need
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're the only thing I need
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're the only thing I need
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're my only friend indeed
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're the only thing I need
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're the only thing I need
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're the only thing I need
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're my only friend indeed
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're the only thing I need
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're the only thing I need
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're the only thing I need
Cause I've been around two times and found that you're my only friend indeed

Step out aching stepson
And you'll fall into the blue
And you'll fall into the blue
Oh I'm coming down for you
Step out aching stepson
And I'll lead you by the hand
And we'll fall into the blue
Oh I'm coming down for you
Oh I'm coming down for you
But I'm falling deeper down I go
And I'm falling down the grounds beneath the road
Now I'm falling deeper down I go
And I'm falling deeper now I known
And I'm falling deeper down the shore
And I'm falling as the rocks way down below
As the rocks way down below
As the rocks way down below
Step out aching stepson
And you'll fall into the blue
And you'll fall into the blue
Oh I'm coming down for you
Step out aching stepson
And I'll lead you by the hand
And we'll fall into the blue
Oh I'm coming down for you
Oh I'm coming down for you
Coming down for you
Coming down for you
Coming down for you
Coming down for you
Now I see you trouble it's coming up ahead
Black dogs running through the fields they're dripping red
The world is quiet there is nothing left unsaid
A million image million capture million dead
And all the birds fall out of the sky in two by two's
And my teeth fall out my head into the snow
I am you now and you are me instead
Then I see there is blood on your wedding dress
And all of the old walk down and I'm feeling unsure
When I'm sleeping in my own place I'm not home
It is perfect it is beautiful and still
And it is silent it is white and it is good
And all by the fooling round with daisy chains on our heads
It is coming now my friend and it's the end
