You've got the blood on your hands I think it's my own
We can go down onto the streets and follow the shores
Of all the people we could be two
Then I bite my nails to the quick run back home
You've got the blood on your hands I know it's my own
You came at me in the middle of the night to show me my soul
Of all the people I hoped it'd be you
To come and free me take me away
To show me my home
Where I was born
Where I belong
You've got the blood on your hands I want you to know
I hoped that you'd come and take me away back to my home
Of all the people it had to be you
Then I bite my nails to the quick run back home
You showed me
Where to go
To my home
To my home
So take me
Through the roads
That you know
To my home
You've got the blood on your hands I know it's my own
You came at me in the middle of the night to show me my soul
You showed me
Where to go
To my home
To my home
So take me
Through the roads
That you know
To my home
(Come and help me accept it affect it protect it
Come and help me accept it it's always my home)
(Come and help me accept it effect it protect it
Come and help me accept it it's always my home)
You showed me
Where to go
To my home
To my home
So take me
Through the roads
That you know
Where you know
You showed me
Where to go
To my home
To my home
So take me
Through the roads
That you know
To my home
(Come and help me accept it affect it protect it
Come and help me accept it it's always my home)
(Come and help me accept it effect it protect it
Come and help me accept it it's always my home)
You've got the blood on your hands I know it's my own
We can go down onto the streets and follow the shores
Of all the people I hoped it'd be you
You showed me my way back home
To where I was born
Where I belong
Where I belong
I promised you open ocean glow
Mother of pearl gold and indigo
Cut through the waves I watched you swim away
I'll never love you more than today
Would you be there
Be there
Be there for me
In Miami
Would you be there
Be there
Be there for me
In Miami
Now black light sets on my short day
Oh you betrayed me you gave it away
You don't mind picking up salt to rub into my wounds
Would you be there
Be there
Be there for me
In Miami
Would you betray me
Or save me
Save me from you
In Miami
Miami bad Miami bad Miami bad Miami bad
Miami bad Miami bad Miami bad Miami bad
Miami bad Miami bad Miami bad Miami bad
Miami bad Miami bad Miami bad Miami bad
Would you be there
Be there
Be there for me
In Miami
Would you betray me
Or save me
Save me from you
In Miami
Would you be there
Be there

In Miami
Would you betray me
Save me
Save me
In Miami
I know a place where I can go
When I'm low down
To your house down to your house
I will go when I'm low
I know a face who I can show
My true colors
To your arms into your arms
I will go when I'm low
'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough no
'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough no
I've seen it all
The skyline and the lone call
To your house down to your house
I will go when I'm low
They took it all
With a view to the great fall
To your arms into your arms
I will go when I'm low
'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough no
'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough no
Singularity is here to stay
So go down go down go down
Go down go down down low
Let's take it slow
Singularity is here to stay for you and me
Go down go down go down
Go down go down down low
Let's take life slow
Go down go down go down
Go down go down down low
Let's take life slow
Go down go down go down
Go down go down down low
Let's take life slow
I know a place where I can go
When I'm low down
To your house down to your house
I will go when I'm low
I know a face who I can show
My true colors
To your arms into your arms
I will go when I'm low
'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough no
'Cause total life forever
Will never be enough no
Top of the world bottom of the ocean
Top of the world bottom of the ocean
They built you up and broke you down again
So now you hope to beat the surf in
Cause the future is not what you see
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what you see
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what it used to be used to be
The future is not what it used to be used to be
Top of the world bottom of the ocean
Top of the world bottom of the ocean
They lit you up and found the ground again
So now you know to beat the surf in
Cause the future is not what you see
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what you see
It's not where you've been to at all
The future is not what it used to be used to be
The future is not what it used to be used to be
They buried the gold your ancestry's sold and left
Just the residue
They buried the gold your ancestry's sold and left
Just the mist of you
They buried the gold your ancestry's sold and left
Just the residue
They buried the gold your ancestry's sold and left
Just the mist of you
Now what's happened to you look what's happened to you
What's happened to you
Now that spring is finally here
Your hollow heart your hollow heart
Drive through the forest and into the night
Away from the city away from the light
Hollow heart your hollow heart
You know
And we're worlds apart
And we're worlds apart
They gouge you out they dug you in
They took the name right out of your mouth
Hollow heart your hollow heart
You know
Worlds apart
And we're worlds apart
Into yourself past of it
Into yourself past of it
Into yourself past of it
Into yourself past of it
Into yourself
Into yourself
Into yourself
Into yourself
Into yourself
Into yourself
So I walked into the haze
And a million dirty waves
Now I see you lying there
Like a lilo losing air air
Black rocks and shoreline sand
Still that summer I cannot bear
And I wipe the sand off my arms
The Spanish Sahara the place that you'd wanna
Leave the horror here
Forget the horror here
Forget the horror here
Leave it all down here
It's future rust and it's future dust
Forget the horror here
Forget the horror here
Leave it all down here
It's future rust and it's future dust
Now the waves they drag you down
Carry you to broken ground
Now I find you in the sand
Wipe you clean with dirty hands
So goddamn this boiling space
The Spanish Sahara the place that you'd wanna
Leave the horror here
Forget the horror here
Forget the horror here
Leave it all down here
It's future rust and it's future dust
I'm the fury in your head
I'm the fury in your bed
I'm the ghost in the back of your head
'Cause I am
I'm the fury in your head
I'm the fury in your bed
I'm the ghost in the back of your head
'Cause I am
I'm the fury in your head
I'm the fury in your bed
I'm the ghost in the back of your head
'Cause I am
Forget the horror here
Forget the horror here
Leave it all down here
It's future rust and it's future dust
Choir of furies in your head
Choir of furies in your bed
I'm the ghost in the back of your head
'Cause I am
Choir of furies in your head
Choir of furies in your bed
I'm the ghost in the back of your head
'Cause I am
Choir of furies in your head
Choir of furies in your bed
I'm the ghost in the back of your head
'Cause I am
And now it's just gone after dark
And we move to the other part of it
Secret part of your restless heart
To glide past every city light
Like a satellite careering through the sky
This colour this summer night
It's your heart it's your heart
That gives me this western feeling
It's your heart it's your heart
That gives me this western feeling
Do you know you give me
You give me this western feeling
Now look back see how far you've come
Will you unravel in the sun
Come undone find your place
Held up high said from string as well
No return to that restless place
You've reached it you've found your grace
It's your heart it's your heart
That gives me this western feeling
It's your heart it's your heart
That gives me this western feeling
Oh do you know you give me
You give me this western feeling
It's your heart it's your heart
That gives me this western feeling
It's your heart it's your heart
That gives me this western feeling
I know I could not last very long at all
Without you here to break my fall
I know I could not stand alone for very long
Without you there to take my coat
'Cause you were better than whatever came before
Before you ran out and left me on the 100th floor
Get out and go and find everyone who cared for you
They won't be there to see you tomorrow
Get out don't forget everything you cared for
For it won't be nothing more tomorrow
No I could not do the things I did before
Leave you waiting there by that open door
You were better than whatever came before
Without you here and my heart broken to the core
Get out and go and find everyone who cared for you
They won't be there to see you tomorrow
Get out don't forget everything you cared for
For it won't be nothing more tomorrow
No I could not stand to be alone for long
There's something missing in the ever after glow
You were better than whatever came before
Without you here to save me to save me from the dark
Get out and go and find everyone who cared for you
They won't be there to see you tomorrow
Get out don't forget everything you cared for
For it won't be nothing more tomorrow
She's up in the sky
She's up in the domes
She's up in the sky up in the dome
I knew a girl who came from VillaLuz
Had a house filled with
Religious regret and infinite debt
Heaven's pressure
She's a light in the dark
She's out of the door
She's up in the sky up in the domes
Alabaster lover
You go and get gone
We make each other
You go and get gone
Alabaster lover
You go and get gone
We make each other
You go and get gone
She's up in the sky and the sky is on fire
She set the whole neighborhood to life
Then the people they'll read out all their names
Run away run away run away
And with victory the whole world would be ours
We will build nothing in it
Nothing in it
Alabaster lover
You go and get gone
We could make each other
You go and get gone
Alabaster lover
You go and get gone
We made each other
You go and get gone
Alabaster lover
We made each other
Help yourself help the rest
Give blood away give blood today
Each drop away
Help yourself help the rest
Inhale exhale
Lungs paper frail
Light up away go
Don't let go just breathe slow
So hold on it will pass
Don't give up don't let go
Grey clouds they'll they'll break up
Rest yourself rest your head
Be still play dead
Learn to acquiesce
Forget all the rest
Free yourself free your head
Don't shy away
Open your veins
In wet summer rain go
Don't let go just breathe slow
So hold on it will pass
Don't give up don't let go
Grey clouds they'll they'll break up
Just breathe slow
Oh I see you in your cobra nest
All dressed up in your Sunday best
In the opal morning light
See your gun there shining bright
Shining bright
Now the storm is on its way
Coming here to break the day
Steaming rain
Oh you go shoot me down
Take my halo yoke and crown
Yoke and crown
'Cause I've been to the darkest place I know
You my dear shouldn't fear what lies below
It's just bones
Now you go softly soft
Picking out better bones than your own
Oh I see you creep in the dark
Sticking pins into the rain
To wash away
And I've been to the only place I know
It's just bones
So you my dear shouldn't fear what lies below
It's just bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
So how can love bear to see you bear to see you go alone
Black and blue this beating heart's got the same blood as your own
As your own
So you my dear shouldn't fear what lies below
It's just bones
And I've been to the darkest place you know
It's just bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
Just bones bones
You can go
Out on your own
But they can take
That forked road
Oh I'll fill their shoes
I tried out all their moods
God I'm trapped
I'm on the moon
I'm on my own
I'm the master pretender
I'm wearing his face
I'm wearing his ring
All hail the king
You don't know
What I'm yet to be
Oh you'll see
Paving is laid
On that forked road
I'll take your coat
Then I'll take your king
Helium heart you're blown apart you'll never find your shadow
Helium heart your hands apart you'll never trap your shadow
In the dark heal your heart you're blown apart ravaged by the callow
From the start helium heart your hands apart you'll never catch your shadow
So keep it up from the start in your hands apart
Flit splits such as from the star
You turn support yeah no call no call me
Your hands in your hands in your hands apart
After dark from the start blown apart
Helium heart you're blown apart you'll never find your shadow
At the start helium heart your hands apart you'll never trap your shadow
In the dark heal your heart you're blown apart you're ravaged by the callow
Helium heat you're blown apart you'll never find your shadow
