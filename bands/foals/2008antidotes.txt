She said these terminals once again
Wasps' nests these terminals once again
These heart swells these contexts in your head
Oh hell no these vessels

Our heart swells up which make us explode

This is our warning shot your final call
An empty maw or gurning hearts hollowed crowns
And all I see is marching bands
Marching bands which never rest in broken stands
Butcherbirds with useless throats
We're not safe of dying kings with plastic knives
It's just another hospital
It's just another it's just another
Captains made with metal tags
Flags brought down of hollowed crowns
It's everything without a time
It's just a it's just a
It's just another hospital
It's just another it's just another
It's just another hospital
It's just another it's just another
Goodbye all your marching bands
Laid to rest in broken stands
Butcherbirds will fly away
This is not a warning call nor final shot
All I see is butcherbirds will fly away electric bloom
It's just another hospital
It's just another it's just another
It's just another hospital
It's just another it's just another

Hey you could say the king is dead
We washed our hands of all we've read
We watch white stars overhead

your mind is just a loaded gun
you see
assasins on the walkway home
you eat yourself
from bones to bones
to tounges to toes
contractors nor the council
can find the time
to peice your head again
the terror we must
the terror we must
avoid and behold
avoid and behold

these warrens are dark
these warrens are long
these warrens go on and on and on
and so we go on
up up and away
away from this town
away from this town
I am a rocket
you are an anchor

we would have know
that there was no home
there was no home
no home to go to
and so we sit here

I could cut my hands off now
Just to fight the skeleton out of me Out of me
We could peel artichoke hearts
And break our legs and dry out
Maybe if we could just talk about the weather
I have three-hundred bombs all in my head
I have three-hundred bombs all in my head
(Maybe if we could just talk about the weather
Maybe if we could just talk about the weather
Maybe if we could just talk about the weather
Maybe if we could just talk about the weather)
I could cut my hands off now
Just to fight the skeleton out of me Out of me
We could peel artichoke hearts
And break our legs and dry out
It's Saturday we could come home and cut the phone lines
It's Saturday we could come home and cut the phone lines
It's Saturday we could come home and cut the phone lines
I could cut my hands off now
Just to fight the skeleton out of me Out of me
We could peel artichoke hearts
And break our legs and dry out
And dry out and dry out
