    <h2>About the project</h2>
    <p>This project is made purely for fun and doesn't have a goal to provide any linguistic insight or anything like that.<br>
    The selection of bands is totally arbitrary and doesn't represent anything. <br>
    This project is still a work in progress since there are still many things that I would like to improve.</p>
